    "description": "Have you been attacked by a wolf-like creature in the last 30 days? Was it after the sun had set and under a full moon? If you answered, \"yes\" to both these questions, there's a very good chance that you were bitten by a werewolf. You now have less than a month before the full moon returns and with it your first transformation into a savage, bloodthirsty beast. Survival is an option, but first, know this: Werewolves are real. The majority of lycanthropes who do not have access to this book die during or shortly after their first transformations, generally due to heart failure, gunshot wounds, exposure, drowning or suicide.  Hollywood horror movies are NOT to be used as guides to living as a werewolf. Their goal is not to educate, but to entertain. As a result, they are largely ignorant of the realities of the condition. Ignorance creates monsters; lycanthropy does not.  You are not a monster.The Werewolf's Guide to Life cuts through the fiction and guides you through your first transformation and beyond, offering indispensable advice on how to tell if you're really a werewolf, post-attack etiquette, breaking the news to your spouse, avoiding government abduction, and how to not just survive, but thrive. You cannot afford to not read this book. Your very life depends on it.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

In today's tough times, we may be forced to reinvent our career or downsize our lives; at any point in life, we may lose a love or a dream. Our first reaction to change we didn't ask for may be to rail against fate. But what if we could see past today's turmoil and spot the opportunities that lie within unasked-for change? That is the promise of AdaptAbility, bestselling author and executive coach M. J. Ryan's paradigm-shifting new book on not merely surviving but thriving when change is required. Why is it so hard to accept change? Paradoxically, it is for the very reason that our brains usually work so well; we are designed to learn something and make it automatic. The problem is that when circumstances change, our \"efficient\" brains keep trying to do things the same old way. In AdaptAbility, Ryan provides strategies to retrain your brain and optimize your response to change, step by step: by first accepting the new reality, then expanding your options, and finally, taking effective action. She offers cutting-edge tools for becoming calmer, less fearful, and more flexible, creative, and resourceful in your thinking. Best of all, as your \"adapt-ability\" increases, so does your confidence that you will be able to face whatever life sends your way and find new ways to flourish.M. J. Ryan, internationally recognized as a leading change expert, is one of the creators of the New York Times bestselling Random Acts of Kindness series and the author of This Year I Will . . . , The Happiness Makeover, The Power of Patience, Trusting Yourself, and Attitudes of Gratitude, among other books. A member of Professional Thinking Partners, she specializes in coaching individuals and teams around the world. She has appeared on the Today show and CNN, and is a contributing editor to Good Housekeeping and Health. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband and daughter.

Depending on the time of day, Regina Burns is a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown or an overdue breakthrough. One shattered heart and six months of rehab have left her wary and shell-shocked--especially with the prospect of taking a temporary consulting job in Atlanta, a move that would allow Regina to rescue the family home that she borrowed against when she was \"a stomp down dope fiend.\" Her stone-faced banker has grudgingly agreed to give her sixty days to settle her debts or lose the house.Returning to Atlanta is a big risk. Last time Regina was there, she lost track of who she was and what she wanted. There's a lot of emotional baggage with her new employer, Beth Davis. Can she really forgive Beth for breaking up her wedding plans on New Year's Eve because she just didn't think Regina was good enough to marry her son?Meanwhile, Regina's visionary Aunt Abbie has told her to be on the lookout for a handsome stranger with \"the ocean in his eyes\" who has a bone to pick and a promise to keep. Then a blue-eyed brother appears on the streets of Afro-Atlanta wearing a black cashmere overcoat, flashing a dazzling smile, and lending a helping hand when Regina needs it most. But between falling for Blue Hamilton and dealing with Beth, secrets will emerge that will threaten to send her life twisting in surprising new directions.Like a conversation with a good friend, Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do shares hope, love, and laugher. As always, it is Pearl Cleage's unforgettable characters and her gift for dialogue that will earn this provocative new novel a place in the hearts of her growing family of readers.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

RiskMetrics has been measuring portfolio risk for big financial institutions since 1994 and now sheds some light on investor risk. RiskGrades helps investors combine risk and return to make proper investment decisions.\"  -BusinessWeek    \"Owning a high percentage of company stock in a retirement plan--any more than 20 percent--is one of the riskiest propositions in investing, and yet employees almost never measure this risk objectively or reduce their positions. . . . It is easy to approximate investment risk. A useful tool for measuring risk is available through RiskMetrics Group's www.riskgrades.com, a service that will measure the volatility and return of single securities or whole portfolios against all asset classes and international regions.\"  -Financial Times    \"Without divining what exactly a fund owns, the system simply distills risk down to the likelihood of finding a severe change in its value on a given day. . . . Running a few notable funds through the rating bath can be a useful check on what an investor is putting on the line for a given dollar of investment gains.\"  -Barron's    \"Mathematicians and economists use complex computer programs to examine the effects of different shocks on different portfolios. Such tests have been used for several years by professionals who manage multimillion-dollar investment funds. But RiskMetrics, a spinoff of J.P. Morgan Chase, is now providing similar tools for individual investors. RiskMetrics runs a Web site, www.riskgrades.com, which investors can use free of charge. The Web site allows investors to stress-test individual stocks and mutual funds as well as portfolios.\"  -The Wall Street Journal",

One is an evolved Artificial Intelligence imprinted with his personality. The other is a perfect clone named Dominic, whom he raises as his son.When Richter suddenly dies, his son Dominic is left to deal with a terrible crisis which threatens ZahlenBank. And though Dominic loathes the egotistical A.I. masquerading as his father, they need each other's help to save the bank.Which of them is the true copy, and which is fake? Do they have free will, or are their destinies programmed in their source code? Does individual identity still have any meaning?What is Neurolink?A new kind of bank account for storing a person's mind...\"Scientists are fools, boys. They keep trying to upload the human mind to a computer. Any idiot knows you can't translate brain matter into binary code. My way is easier and cheaper – and more profitable for the bank. We just record a person's life in real time. Document the memories as they happen, instead of trying to slice-and-dice neurons later. Hell, why not? ZahlenBank's cameras cover every square centimeter of this hemisphere. Video, audio, email, financial and medical history, employment records, every freakin' iota. Think of the fee we could charge!\"Boys, we're talking a complete digital record of perfect memories, better than real ones because time won't distort 'em. And we'll have designer packaging.

    "description": "Networking is the key skill for the 21st century worker. As birth rates go down, life expectancy goes up and the business world continues to downsize to a core of permanent workers, more of us will find the 21st century a tough place to make a living. More of us will find ourselves working as freelancers or as part of 'fractional teams' that come together for a project and then disband. Fewer of us will retire on a pension - choosing instead to work on a portfolio of projects.A Friend in Every City looks first at the forces shaping the new ways of working, then at how online networks, such as LinkedIn, Open BC, Ryze and Ecademy, are evolving to provide support for them. The authors look at how an individual worker can leverage these changes to their best effect.Networks can provide us with support in all aspects of our lives. A good network will sustain us through bad times as well as good, providing emotional support as well as referrals. Contacts become connections, connections become advocates and advocates become friends.Can the new networks provide the basis for something more than personal friendship and business? If we can look forward to having a true friend in every city around the world, what changes might that bring? Can conversations change the world?",

    "description": "Throughout history fables have been a popular method of giving instruction. Fables contain a short narrative that seeks to illustrate a hidden message. Generally, fables use animals or objects as part of the narrative yet the message is designed to apply to humans. By doing this, the fabulist is not perceived as the teacher and this reduces any bias the listeners might have against the person. The most famous fabulist would be Aesop who most date around 620 B.C. Many fables are attributed to Aesop, but it's unclear how many he actually wrote; indeed, his historical existence as a person is under question. Here is a collection of over 300 of Aesop's classics.Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.  The Microsoft eBook has a contents page linked to the chapter headings for easy navigation. The Adobe eBook has bookmarks at chapter headings and is printable up to two full copies per year.

Geraldine Steel, a woman whose past is threatening to collide with her future. When D.I.

But when she finds herself pitted against a twisted killer preying on local young women she quickly discovers how wrong she is... By day, the park is a place for children's games, for people walking their dogs or taking a short cut to avoid the streets. But in the shadows a predator prowls, hunting for a fresh victim. When an unwitting bystander comes forward as a witness she quickly becomes the next object of his murderous obsessions - someone whom the killer must stop at all costs. D.I. Geraldine Steel is locked into a race against time, determined to find the killer before they discover yet another naked corpse . But can she save the lives of the town's young women - or will Geraldine herself become the killer's ultimate trophy?",

Coaching Science will bridge that gap covering both theory and practice and, most important, showing how theory informs practice. The book will be multi- and, to some extent, inter-disciplinary, as it is not possible to examine the interaction between coach, performer and task from a single discipline perspective.   Each chapter will include overviews of the main theories, but the bulk of the material will be concerned with how such theories can be applied in practice. Good and frequent use of examples will be provided. Throughout, the student will be given problems to solve. At the end of each chapter there will be revision notes, recommended readings and questions on chapter content.",

The kitsch of today aspires to become an alternative to art -- not as a domineering concept -- but as an enrichment together with art, and as a means for artists and critics to find an expression which expands our culture. Perhaps art historians may attain the freedom to interpret other values, transcending the strict criteria of art.\" -- full text of the back cover.",

National Health Security Strategy Identifies Goals and Strategic Objectives for the Nation As noted in the National Health Security Strategy document, national health security is achieved when the Nation and its people are prepared for, protected from, ready to respond to, and able to recover from incidents with potentially catastrophic health consequences. The NHSS is designed to achieve two goals: 1. Build community resilience; 2. Strengthen and sustain health and emergency response systems. These goals are supported by ten strategic objectives, which address areas that require urgent and focused attention and improvement. The strategic objectives describe what must be accomplished to address current gaps in national health security over the next four years and to maintain improvements in health security over the longer term. The ten strategic objectives are: 1. Foster informed, empowered individuals and communities 2. Develop and maintain the workforce needed for national health security 3. Ensure situational awareness 4. Foster integrated, scalable health care delivery systems 5. Ensure timely and effective communications 6. Promote an effective countermeasures enterprise 7. Ensure prevention or mitigation of environmental and other emerging threats to health 8. Incorporate post-incident health recovery into planning and response 9. Work with cross-border and global partners to enhance national, continental, and global health security 10. Ensure that all systems that support national health security are based upon the best available science, evaluation, and quality improvement methods.",

    "description": "We provide a comprehensive view of widening income inequality in the United States contrasting conditions since 1980 with those in earlier postwar years. We argue that the income distribution in each period was strongly shaped by a set of economic institutions. The early postwar years were dominated by unions, a negotiating framework set in the Treaty of Detroit, progressive taxes, and a high minimum wage - all parts of a general government effort to broadly distribute the gains from growth. More recent years have been characterized by reversals in all these dimensions in an institutional pattern known as the Washington Consensus. Other explanations for income disparities including skill-biased technical change and international trade are seen as factors operating within this broader institutional story.

These deposits are divided into three lithostratigraphic groups: the Delaware Bay Group, the Assawoman Bay Group (named herein), and the Nanticoke River Group (named herein). The Delaware Bay Group, mapped along the margins of Delaware Bay, is subdivided into the Lynch Heights Formation and the Scotts Corners Formation. The Assawoman Bay Group, recognized inland of Delaware's Atlantic Coast, is subdivided into the Omar Formation, the Ironshire Formation, and the Sinepuxent Formation. The Nanticoke River Group, found along the margins of the Nanticoke River and its tributaries, is subdivided into the Turtle Branch Formation (named herein) and the Kent Island Formation. Delaware Bay Group deposits consist of bay-margin coarse sand and gravel that fine upward to silt and silty sand. Beds of organic-rich mud were deposited in tidal marshes. Near the present Atlantic Coast, the Delaware Bay Group includes organic-rich muds and shelly muds deposited in lagoonal environments. Assawoman Bay Group deposits range from very fine, silty sands to silty clays with shells deposited in back-barrier lagoons, to fine to coarse, well-sorted sands deposited in barriers and spits. Nanticoke River Group deposits consist of coarse sand and gravel that fine upward to silty clays. Oyster shells are found associated with the clays in the Turtle Branch Formation. Organic-rich clayey silts were deposited in swamps and estuaries. Well-sorted fine sands to gravelly sands were deposited on beaches and tidal flats on the flanks of the ancestral Nanticoke River and its tributaries. The Lynch Heights, Omar, and Turtle Branch Formations are age-equivalent units associated with highstands of sea level,which occurred at approximately 400,000 and 325,000 yrs B.P. (MIS 11 and 9, respectively). The Scotts Corners, Ironshire, Sinepuxent, and Kent Island Formations are age-equivalent units associated with highstands of sea level, which occurred between 120,000 and 80,000 yrs B.P.

Dr. Boss helps caregivers find hope in \"ambiguous loss\" having a loved one both here and not here, physically present but psychologically absent. Outlines seven guidelines to stay resilient while caring for someone who has dementia. Discusses the meaning of relationships with individuals who are cognitively impaired and no longer as they used to be. Offers approaches to understand and cope with the emotional strain of care-giving. Boss's book builds on research and clinical experience, yet the material is presented as a conversation. She shows you a way to embrace rather than resist the ambiguity in your relationship with someone who has dementia\"--Provided by publisher.",

Led by husband-and-wife team E. David Klonksy, PhD, and Alexis Black, the psychologists contributing to The Psychology of Twilight look at love, family, vampires, werewolves, and our Twilight obsession, and offer more than a dozen fascination new angles on the series--just in time for the November 2011 release of Breaking Dawn, part one.  Why Edward captivates Bella (it's not the perfect face or chiseled abs--it's as chemical as Edward's attraction to the smell of Bella's blood)   Vampirism as eating disorder (and what we can learn from how the Cullens cope)   Twilight's rejection of strict dualities like good/evil and human/monster and what that has to do with the way our minds process experience and information   The psychological benefits of Twilight fandom. and more fresh insights into the series that's enthralled millions\"--",

This book presents one of the most commonly used grammatical formalisms, Unification Grammars, which underlies contemporary linguistic theories such as Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The book provides a robust and rigorous exposition of the formalism that is both mathematically well-founded and linguistically motivated. While the material is presented formally, and much of the text is mathematically oriented, a core chapter of the book addresses linguistic applications and the implementation of several linguistic insights in unification grammars. Dozens of examples and numerous exercises (many with solutions) illustrate key points.

With uniquely wild style, the 2010 San Francisco Giants follow the 1969 New York Mets and 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers into history as a World Championship team whose success was supposed to be impossible. Welcome to the place where rally thongs meet Zen lessons, where relentless discipline meets fake beards, where the year-long neighborhood party culminates in a million being blessed by the team's Pope in the name of Mays and McCovey. This is the kind of legendary year for which all baseball lovers live, told from deep inside and beyond. This is the timeless beauty and hilarity of life itself, a rich story even for those who never knew before why to care about the game\"--",

So when Ray Schiller--an American televangelist with the uncanny ability to miraculously heal the ill--becomes uncomfortably close to the Prime Minister, External Assets dispatches the brilliant, beautiful, and entirely unpredictable Persephone Hazard to infiltrate the Golden Promise Ministry and discover why the preacher is so interested in British politics.

    "description": "\"In Asia, English is no longer a foreign language but a key resource for education, government, business and the general public. Whereas thirty years ago, British and American experts believed that the best way to improve the quality of English teaching was to cancel any programs below the secondary level, Asian nations as well as European are now introducing English in primary school. But there are major obstacles to overcome: the training of enough local teachers or the hiring of English speakers, the preparation of suitable teaching materials, the development of useful tests, and the design of workable curriculums. The chapters in this book, written by leading English-teaching professionals in seven Asian countries and originally delivered at the 2010 annual conference of Asia TEFL which took place in Hanoi, Vietnam, describe and analyze national policies and how they are implemented. The coverage is wide: China with its huge number of students learning English, Japan working to make the transition from elementary to secondary school seamless, Singapore continuing to use English as medium of instruction for its multilingual population, Korea developing English education policies to recognize the increased role of English alongside the national language, India building on its colonial past to make English an economic resource, Vietnam fitting English into a program of national rebuilding, and Taiwan spreading its English teaching outside the national capital. This is not a report of the views of outside experts, but of local experiences understood by local scholars of international standing. Policy makers, educators, researchers and scholars will be able to gain valuable insights from Asian experts\"--",

Building on the remarkable story of our own solar system from his bestselling book Destiny or Chance, Stuart Ross Taylor now takes the reader further, comparing our solar system with the wider universe. How are planets made, and why are they are different from stars? Why are exoplanets all different from one another and from our familiar eight planets? What can Earth's nearest neighbours tell us about planetary processes in the whole universe? Why does Earth harbour life? Beginning with the basic concepts of planet formation and the composition of the universe, the book then summarizses our knowledge of exoplanets, how they compare with our planets, and why some stars have better habitable zones. Further sections provide a detailed study of our solar system, as a basis for understanding exoplanetary systems, and a detailed study of the Earth as our only current example of a habitable planet. The book concludes with a philosophical and historical discussion of topics surrounding planets and the development of life, including why our chances of finding aliens on exoplanets is very low. This is an engaging and informative read for anyone interested in planetary formation and the exploration of our universe\"--",

Many reports of highly efficient separations and methods have been published over the past 15 years. CE offers several advantages over high-pressure or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These include simplicity, rapid analysis, automation, ruggedness, different mechanisms for selectivity, and low cost. Moreover, EC requires smaller sample size and yet offers higher efficiency and thus greater resolution power over HPLC. These characteristics are very attractive in research and development, even more so in pharmaceutical quality control (QC) and stability monitoring (SM) studies. This book will provide busy pharmaceutical scientists a complete yet concise reference guide for utilizing the versatility of CE in new drug development and quality control. - Provides current status and future developments in CE analysis of pharmaceuticals. - Explains how to develop and validate methods. - Includes major pharmaceutical applications including assays and impurity testing.",

But when she proves to have a particular skill at harnessing the relics' powers, Maggie is whisked away to the glamorous hacienda of A lvar Castilla, the wealthy young relic baron who runs Burning Mesa.

While some books explore our genetic inheritance and popular television shows celebrate ancestry, this is the first book to explore how everything from DNA to emotions to names and the stories that form our lives are all part of our human legacy. Kenneally shows how trust is inherited in Africa, silence is passed down in Tasmania, and how the history of nations is written in our DNA. From fateful, ancient encounters to modern mass migrations and medical diagnoses, Kenneally explains how the forces that shaped the history of the world ultimately shape each human who inhabits it\"--Provided by publisher.",

Because is the beginning long ago when Sinead first spoke up for him after Charlie got in trouble at school for the millionth time?

Advances in the capabilities of numerical modeling software, together with ever increasing computational speeds, have made it possible to investigate the very nature of the large-scale rock mass and its response to mining excavations. The improved understanding of the rock response obtained from modeling enhances our designs, resulting in greater stability and safety of the mining excavations. To help advance the state of the art in this field, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health organized the International Workshop on Numerical Modeling for Underground Mine Excavation Design. The workshop was held in Asheville, NC, on June 28, 2009, in association with the 43rd U.S. Rock Mechanics Symposium. The proceedings include 10 papers from leading rock mechanics and numerical modeling experts in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany. The papers address a wide range of issues, including various numerical modeling approaches, rock mass modeling, and applications in coal and metal mines.\" - NIOSHTIC-2",

In language both spare and direct yet wondrously lyrical, LIFE IS SHORT BUT WIDE is an irresistible story of family that proves no matter who you are or what you do, you are never too old to chase your dreams.Like the small towns J. California Cooper has so vividly portrayed in her previous novels and story collections, Wideland, Oklahoma, is home to ordinary Americans struggling to raise families, eke out a living, and fulfill their dreams. In the early twentieth century, Irene and Val fall in love in Wideland. While carving out a home for themselves, they also allow neighbors Bertha and Joseph to build a house and live on their land. The next generation brings two girls for Irene and Val, and a daughter for Bertha and Joseph. As the families cope with the hardships that come with changing times and fortunes, and people are born and pass away, the characters learn the importance of living one's life boldly and squeezing out every possible moment of joy. Cooper brilliantly captures the cadences of the South and draws a picture of American life at once down-to-earth and heartwarming in this-as her wise narrator will tell you-\"strange, sad, kind'a beautiful, life story.\" It is a story about love that leads to the ultimate realization that whoever you are, and whatever you do, life is short, but it is also wide.",

In The Lost World of the Old Ones, David Roberts expands and updates the research from his 1996 classic, In Search of the Old Ones. As he elucidates startling archaeological breakthroughs, Roberts also recounts his past twenty years of far-flung exploits in search of spectacular prehistoric ruins and rock-art panels known to very few modern travelers. His adventures range across Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado and illuminate the mysteries of the Ancestral Puebloans and their contemporary neighbors the Mogollon and Fremont, as well as of the more recent Navajo and Comanche. Roberts uses his climbing and exploratory know-how to reach the remote sanctuaries of the Old Ones hidden high on nearly vertical cliffs, many of which are unknown to archaeologists and park rangers. As a passionate advocate for an experiential encounter with history, Roberts mixes the findings of experts with personal explorations to raise questions that archaeologists have yet to address\"--Provided by publisher.",

The catalogue explores the evolution of a Gesamtkunstwerk in the work of Kandinsky including essays by leading Kandinsky scholars on painting as a total work of art, or the artist's interest in music and theatre. Separated into three sections, it illustrates how Kandinsky's fascination for the Wagnerian concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk and the principles of synesthesia developed into large-scale painting within the context of the two highly significant artistic groups Blaue Reiter and Bauhaus, as well as in response to the changing historical circumstances, last but not least, culminating in his large-scale decorative utopian murals and installations.

They've faced everything together, from youthful sprees and scrapes to mid-life turning points. Now, as Anna, the group's trailblazer and brightest spark, enters hospice, they gather to do what they've always done--talk and laugh and help each other make choices and plans, this time in Anna's rural Massachusetts home. Helen, Anna's best friend and a celebrated painter, is about to remarry. The others face their own challenges--Caroline with her sister's mental health crisis; Molly with a teenage daughter's rebellion; Ming with her law practice--dilemmas with kids and work and love. Before Everything is as funny as it is bittersweet, as the friends revel in the hilarious mistakes they've seen one another through, the secrets kept and adventures shared. But now all sense of time has shifted, and the pattern of their lives together takes on new meaning. The novel offers a brilliant, emotionally charged portrait, deftly conveying the sweep of time over everyday lives, and showing how even in difficult endings, gifts can unfold. Above all it is an ode to friendship, and to how one person shapes the journeys of those around her\"--",

The etiquette of the invitation, the balance of guests at a weekend house party, their 'placement' at dinners, and the entertainment of friends, as well as the domestic management required to execute the perfect occasion, have all preoccupied successive generations of chatelaines. This book tells the story four real life weekends - from 1866 to 1936 - when the great and the good gathered at Highclere to change the world in some large or small part.

    "description": "What makes computer programs fast or slow? To answer this question, we have to get behind the abstractions of programming languages and look at how a computer really works. This book examines and explains a variety of scientific programming models (programming models relevant to scientists) with an emphasis on how programming constructs map to different parts of the computer's architecture. Two themes emerge: program speed and program modularity. Throughout this book, the premise is to \"get under the hood,\" and the discussion is tied to specific programs.  The book digs into linkers, compilers, operating systems, and computer architecture to understand how the different parts of the computer interact with programs. It begins with a review of C/C++ and explanations of how libraries, linkers, and Makefiles work. Programming models covered include Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI, TCP/IP, and CUDA.The emphasis on how computers work leads the reader into computer architecture and occasionally into the operating system kernel. The operating system studied is Linux, the preferred platform for scientific computing. Linux is also open source, which allows users to peer into its inner workings. A brief appendix provides a useful table of machines used to time programs.  -- Provided by publisher.",

Businesses, too, have benefited from the cloud, outsourcing much of their information technology to cloud services. Science, however, has not fully exploited the advantages of the cloud. Could scientific discovery be accelerated if mundane chores were automated and outsourced to the cloud? Leading computer scientists Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon argue that it can, and in this book offer a guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The book surveys the technology that underpins the cloud, new approaches to technical problems enabled by the cloud, and the concepts required to integrate cloud services into scientific work. It covers managing data in the cloud, and how to program these services; computing in the cloud, from deploying single virtual machines or containers to supporting basic interactive science experiments to gathering clusters of machines to do data analytics; using the cloud as a platform for automating analysis procedures, machine learning, and analyzing streaming data; building your own cloud with open source software; and cloud security.

But, how judgmental are you, and how does this impact your relationships? [The author] reveals how everyday judgments impact our relationships, and how praise, blame, and shame shape our sense of self. Our obsession with praise and blame begins soon after birth. Totally dependent on others, rapidly we learn to value praise, and to fear the consequences of blame. Despite outgrowing an infant's dependence, we continue to monitor others' judgments of us, and we ourselves develop what relational psychologist Terri Apter calls a \"judgment meter,\" which constantly scans people and our interactions with them, and registers a positive or negative opinion. In[this book, the author] reveals how interactions between parents and children, within couples, and among friends and colleagues are permeated with praise and blame that range far beyond specific compliments and accusations. Drawing on three decades of research, [the author] gives us the tools to learn about our personal needs, goals and values, to manage our biases, to tolerate others' views, and to make sense of our most powerful, and often confusing, responses to ourselves and to others.\"--Amazon.com.",

Master garden designers Hoichi Kurisu, Takeo Uesugi, David Slawson, Shin Abe, and Marc Keane, have each interpreted the style and meaning of the Japanese garden in unique ways in their innovative designs for private, commercial, and public spaces. Several recent Japanese-style gardens by each designer are featured in this book with detailed descriptions and sumptuous colour photos. Hoichi Kurisu transformative spaces for spiritual and physical equilibrium. Takeo Uesugi bright, flowing gardens that evoke joyful living. David Slawson evocations of native place that fuse with the surrounding landscape. Shin Abe dynamically balanced 'visual stories' that produce meaning and comfort. Marc Keane reflections on human connections with nature through the art of gardens. Also included are essays on the designers and mini-essays by them about gardens in Japan which have most inspired their work, as well as commentaries by patrons and visitors to their North American gardens.

The story begins on an undisclosed island where the unnamed narrator and her father are the two newest and least liked members of a commune that has taken up residence there. Though the commune was built on utopian principles, it quickly becomes clear that life here is not as harmonious as the founders intended. After immersing us in life on the island, our young heroine takes us back to Boston to recount the events that brought her here. Though she and her father belong to a wide Ethiopian network in the city, they mostly keep to themselves, which is how her father prefers it. This detached existence only makes Ayale's arrival on the scene more intoxicating. The unofficial king of Boston's Ethiopian community, Ayale is a born hustler--when he turns his attention to the narrator, she feels seen for the first time. Ostensibly a parking lot attendant, Ayale soon proves to have other projects in the works, which the narrator becomes more and more entangled in to her father's growing dismay. By the time the scope of Ayale's schemes--and their repercussions--become apparent, our narrator has unwittingly become complicit in something much bigger and darker than she ever imagined.",

The book documents the work of Dominic Di Mare who pioneered dimensional weaving in the 1960s and forged new sculptural directions with cast paper in the 1970s. He received further acclaim from the 1970s through the 1990s for expanding the use of mixed media in intimate sculptures: first by combining knotted linen with clay, and later by combining branches with delicate feathers, beads, paper, and horsehair. Though these are simple materials, in Di Mare's hands they were transformed into works seen as intensely poetic, enigmatic, or relaying a spiritual presence. In the past few decades, the object maker reset his compass to explore luminous watercolor on paper in a singular way. He made precise cutouts in his unique artist's books to provide alluring clues for subsequent pages, while in the flat watercolors of his surreal self-portrait series, he painted such dense compositions that there is an illusion of dimensional realms. The very name Di Mare translates as \"of the sea\" and is the legacy of his forebears. Repetition bears additional meanings within the heartbeat of his work. Dominic Di Mare's work is an eloquent reminder of art's power to transmute the personal into signs and symbols of the universal to connect with our own imagination.",

After Emily recounts the extraordinary lives of Mabel Loomis Todd and her daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, and the powerful literary legacy they shared. Mabel's complicated relationships with the Dickinsons--including her thirteen-year extramarital affair with Emily's brother, Austin--roiled the small town of Amherst, Massachusetts. Mabel and Austin's love led to her work with Emily Dickinson's poetry, which inspired both Mabel's life and her daughter's, and fed controversies over the poetry's promotion, editing, and ownership. Julie Dobrow has unearthed hundreds of primary sources to tell this compelling narrative and reveal the surprising impact Mabel and Millicent had on the Emily Dickinson we know today\"--",

Various outcomes--good and bad--are possible. Yet our approach to the future is characterized by short-term thinking, polarizing debates, alarmist rhetoric, and pessimism. In this short, exhilarating book, renowned scientist and bestselling author Martin Rees argues that humanity's prospects depend on our taking a very different approach to planning for tomorrow. The future of humanity is bound to the future of science and hinges on how successfully we harness technological advances to address our challenges. If we are to use science to solve our problems while avoiding its dystopian risks, we must think rationally, globally, collectively, and optimistically about the long term. Advances in biotechnology, cybertechnology, robotics, and artificial intelligence--if pursued and applied wisely--could empower us to boost the developing and developed world and overcome the threats humanity faces on Earth, from climate change to nuclear war. At the same time, further advances in space science will allow humans to explore the solar system and beyond with robots and AI. But there is no \"Plan B\" for Earth--no viable alternative within reach if we do not care for our home planet. Rich with fascinating insights into cutting-edge science and technology, this accessible book will captivate anyone who wants to understand the critical issues that will define the future of humanity on Earth and beyond.",

[The author, a] rabbi [and] a psychiatrist, shares with us some of the invaluable insights he has gained through his extensive experience.... There are many stresses in daily living, but we can take distress out of stress. We can modify our attitudes, use coping techniques, and reach out for help. Even big challenges can be dealt with effectively. [The author] shows how we can put a different spin on things, so that we can be more productive and happier. Here are just a few of the many ideas you'll find in this book: there's magic in a smile; stress can be beneficial; some mountains melt into molehills; lack of success is not equivalent to failure; you're more okay than not.... In this book, [the author] points out some of the things we can do. His simple, down-to-earth ideas are refreshing in a world of complexities. -Back cover.",

One would be hard pressed to find a device that works without relaying on any electromagnetic principle or effect. This text provides a good theoretical understanding of the electromagnetic field equations but also treats a large number of applications. In fact, no topic is presented unless it is directly applicable to engineering design or unless it is needed for the understanding of another topic. In electrostatics, for example, the text includes discussions of photocopying, ink-jet printing, electrostatic separation and deposition, sandpaper production, paint spraying, and powder coating. In magnetics, the applications discussed include electric motors, implantable magnets, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetic stirring of molten materials, and electromagnetic braking and bearings. Electric motors and transformers are used to demonstrate the ideas of magnetic forces and torques and of induction; the applications discussed include the new super-efficient electric drives, linear induction motors, and implantable transformers to power life-sustaining devices. The discussion of wave-propagation phenomena will include applications of new materials to aerospace systems, such as the so-called stealth materials, as well as the use of electromagnetic weaves for materials processing, such as grain drying with microwaves, microwave detection of explosives, and remote sensing of the earth and its resources.",

It has been designed to provide high-resolution measurements (both temporal and spatial) of auroral plasma characteristics. The high telemetry rate, together with the 15 Mbyte distributed on-board memories allow Freja to resolve meso and micro-scale phenomena in the 100 m range for particles and 1--10 m range for electric and magnetic fields. The UV imager resolves auroral structures of 1 km size at a time resolution of one image every 6 s. The novel plasma instruments are orders of magnitude better than any that have gone before. <br/> <em>The Freja Mission</em> is about the scientific objectives, instruments and platform itself. Detailed descriptions are given of the instrumentation and the first data acquired.

These are essential for design and growth of structures with complex doping profiles. Since Metalorganic MBE permits selective area growth, the latest information on its application to the INP/GaInAs(P) system is presented. The chapters on the properties of the heterostructures and devices illustrate in detail the use of such analytical methods as high resolution x-ray diffraction, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, several photoluminescene methods, and the use of active devices for materials evaluation. In addition, the latest information on state-of-the-art InP/GaInAs(p) optoelectronic devices and bipolar transistors grown by MBE methods is presented. As far as we are aware, this information has not previously been presented in a unified format. We expect that this book will be particulary useful to workers in the field, and their management, that are interested in evaluating these MBE methods for reserach and for device development, and to students from the variety of fields that contribute to the growth of solid state electronics. For the latter it presents, in very clear form, introductions to a variety of topics. We have emphasized the InP/GaInAs(P) system because the need for precision structures in this system was the primary driving force for the development of alternate MBE methods, and because it is one of rising importance, vital to optical communications systems, of great potential for future ultra-highspeed electronics, and with other potential appl.s.a. int.opt.ele.",

    "description": "For many decades, the semiconductor industry has miniaturized transistors, delivering increased computing power to consumers at decreased cost. However, mere transistor downsizing does no longer provide the same improvements. One interesting option to further improve transistor characteristics is to use high mobility materials such as germanium and III-V materials. However, transistors have to be redesigned in order to fully benefit from these alternative materials.High Mobility and Quantum Well Transistors: Design and TCAD Simulation investigates planar bulk Germanium pFET technology in chapters 2-4, focusing on both the fabrication of such a technology and on the process and electrical TCAD simulation. Furthermore, this book shows that Quantum Well based transistors can leverage the benefits of these alternative materials, since they confine the charge carriers to the high-mobility material using a heterostructure. The design and fabrication of one particular transistor structure - the SiGe Implant-Free Quantum Well pFET – is discussed. Electrical testing shows remarkable short-channel performance and prototypes are found to be competitive with a state-of-the-art planar strained-silicon technology. High mobility channels, providing high drive current, and heterostructure confinement, providing good short-channel control, make a promising combination for future technology nodes.",

    "description": "There is an urgent need for a complete model of concrete systems. One of the most important properties is the transport of moisture into and out of the microstructure and the transport of aggressive chemicals into and through this structure. Although the need is great, present models are incomplete. However, various strategies have been defined and important partial models have been developed. Both computer-based models and mathematical expressions describe transport and deterioration processes. Computer models account for the spatial distribution of phases, but encounter problems of scale, while mathematical expressions are unable to account explicitly for the spatial distribution of phases. Since such properties as permeability depend on the connectivity of pores (i.e. the shape and spatial distribution of pores) in addition to the volume fraction, microstructural models must be developed further. Nevertheless, the 30 contributions to this book present the most up-to-date summary of knowledge about concrete systems and their modelling, covering the scale and resolution of models; spatial distributions; databases and expert systems; transport mechanisms and the major parameters affecting them; and corrosion mechanisms and parameters.",

These protocols use strong cryptography to prevent intruders from reading or modifying the messages. However, using cryptography is not enough to ensure their correctness. Combined with their typical small size, which suggests that one could easily assess their correctness, this often results in incorrectly designed protocols.</p><p>The authors present a methodology for formally describing security protocols and their environment. This methodology includes a model for describing protocols, their execution model, and the intruder model. The models are extended with a number of well-defined security properties, which capture the notions of correct protocols, and secrecy of data. The methodology can be used to prove that protocols satisfy these properties. Based on the model they have developed a tool set called Scyther that can automatically find attacks on security protocols or prove their correctness. In case studies they show the application of the methodology as well as the effectiveness of the analysis tool.</p><p>The methodology’s strong mathematical basis, the strong separation of concerns in the model, and the accompanying tool set make it ideally suited both for researchers and graduate students of information security or formal methods and for advanced professionals designing critical security protocols.</p><p>",

    "description": "Few areas of human expertise are so well understood that they can be completely reduced to general principles. Similarly, there are few domains in which experience is so extensive that every new problem precisely matches a previous problem whose solution is known. When neither rules nor examples are individually sufficient, problem-solving expertise depends on integrating both. This book presents a computational framework for the integration of rules and cases for analytic tasks typified by legal analysis. The book uses the framework for integrating cases and rules as a basis for a new model of legal precedents. This model explains how the theory under which a case is decided controls the case's precedential effect. The framework for integrating rules and cases is implemented in GREBE, a system for legal analysis. The book presents techniques for representing, indexing, and comparing complex cases and for converting justification structures based on rules and case into natural-language text. This book will interest researchers in artificial intelligence, particularly those involved in case-based reasoning, artificial intelligence and law, and formal models of argumentation, and to scholars in legal philosophy, jurisprudence, and analogical reasoning.",

    "description": "Both molecular spectroscopy and computational chemistry have witnessed rapid significant progresses in recent years. On the one hand, it is nowadays possible to compute, to quite a reasonable degree of accuracy, almost all fundamental spectroscopic properties for small molecular systems. The theoretical approach is now properly considered to be of fundamental importance in attaining a high degree of understanding of spectroscopic information. Moreover, it may be also a great help in designing and planning experiments. On the other hand, new and very powerful experimental techniques have been developed. This book combines an advanced teaching standpoint with an emphasis on the interplay between theoretical and experimental molecular spectroscopy. It covers a wide range of topics (such as molecular dynamics and reactivity, conformational analysis, hydrogen bonding and solvent effects, spectroscopy of excited states, complex spectra interpretation and simulation, software development and biochemical applications of molecular spectroscopy) and considers a large variety of molecular spectroscopic techniques, either from an experimental or from a theoretical perspective.

The study focused on three classes of problems arising in communication networks. (C1). Unicast service provisioning in wired networks. (C2). Multi-rate multicast service provisioning in wired networks. (C3). Power allocation and spectrum sharing in multi-user multi-channel wireless communication systems.  Problems in (C1) are market problems; problems in (C2) are a combination of markets and public goods; problems in (C3) are public goods.</p><p>Dr. Kakhbod developed game forms/mechanisms for unicast and multi-rate multicast service provisioning that possess specific properties. First, the allocations corresponding to all Nash equilibria (NE) of the games induced by the mechanisms are optimal solutions of the corresponding centralized allocation problems, where the objective is the maximization of the sum of the agents'  utilities.  Second, the strategic agents voluntarily participate in the allocation process.  Third, the budget is balanced at the allocations corresponding to all NE of the game induced by the mechanism as well as at all other feasible allocations. For the power allocation and spectrum sharing problem, he developed a game form that possesses the second and third properties as detailed above along with a fourth property: the allocations corresponding to all NE of the game induced by the mechanism are Pareto optimal.</p><p>The thesis contributes to the state of the art of mechanism design theory. In particular, designing efficient mechanisms for the class of problems that are a combination of markets and public goods, for the first time, have been addressed in this thesis.  The exposition, although highly rigorous and technical, is elegant and insightful which makes this thesis work easily accessible to those just entering this field and will also be much appreciated by experts in the field.</p>",

    "description": "Switched-Current Design and Implementation of Oversampling A/D Converters discusses the switched-current (SI) technique and its application in oversampling A/D converters design. The SI technique is an analog sampled-data technique that fully exploits the digital CMOS process. Compared with the traditional switched-capacitor (SC) technique, the SI technique has both pros and cons that are highlighted in the book. With the consideration of similarity and difference of SI and SC techniques, oversampling A/D converter architectures are tailored and optimized for SI design and implementation in the book. Switched-Current Design and Implementation of Oversampling A/D Converters emphasizes the practical aspects of SI circuits without tedious mathematical derivations, and is full of circuit design and implementation examples. There are more than 10 different chips included in the book, demonstrating the high-speed (over 100 MHz) and ultra-low-voltage (1.2 V) operation of SI circuits and systems in standard digital CMOS processes. Therefore, the book is of special value as a practical guide for designing SI circuits and SI oversampling A/D converters. Switched-Current Design and Implementation of Oversampling A/D Converters serves as an excellent reference for analog designers, especially A/D converter designers, and is of interest to digital designers for real-time signal processing who need A/D interfaces.

When the groom dies before a wedding can take place, seventeen-year-old Spring Swallow is ordered to become a ghost bride to appease his spirit. Under her in-laws' protection, she will be little more than a servant, unable to know real love or bear children. Refusing to accept her fate as a \"bad-luck woman\", Spring Swallow flees on her wedding day. In the city of Soochow, Spring Swallow joins a community of renowned embroiderers. The women work for Aunty Peony, whose exquisite stitching once earned her the Emperor's love. But when Aunty Peony agrees to replicate a famous painting -- a lucrative assignment that will take a year to complete -- betrayal and jealousy emerge within the group. Spring Swallow becomes entangled in each woman's story of heartbreak, even while she embarks on a dangerous affair with a young revolutionary. On a journey that leads from the remote hillsides around Soochow to cosmopolitan Peking, Spring Swallow draws on the secret techniques learned from Aunty Peony and her own indomitable strength, determined to forge a life that is truly her own\"--Back cover.",

And yet, as Marcus Buckingham astutely points out, even though the strengths-based approach is now conventional wisdom, the tools and systems inside organizations-performance appraisals, training programs, and succession planning systems-remain stubbornly remedial, exclusively focused on measuring skills, finding gaps, and attempting to plug them. It's a crisis for individuals and organizations, with management ideas and management practice utterly out of sync. That's about to change. StandOut 2.0 is a revolutionary book and tool that enables you to identify your strengths, and those of your team, and to act on them. The original StandOut provided top-notch management insights from one of the world's foremost authorities on strengths, as well as access to a powerful, cutting edge online assessment tool. Now, in addition to a much more powerful assessment, and a robust report on your most dominant strengths, StandOut 2.0 provides: - A StandOut profile, easily customized and exported, that you can use to present the very best of yourself to your team, and your company - Your own Personalized Strengths Channel, which, after taking the 15 minute assessment, will send you a weekly tip, insight, or technique, to help you do your best work this week - For team leaders, the ability to create a team dashboard including each member's StandOut profile, to help you make the right moves - Access to an entire strengths-based performance management system, including a check-in tool to capture priorities and track engagement; a survey tool to help you gauge what your team is thinking and feeling; and an evaluation tool to help reveal real-time performance levels of every single team member StandOut 2.0 is your indispensable guide and tool for building on your strengths to further your career, and to help your team and organization win\"--",

To help quilters gain confidence, Wood also offers detailed lessons for stitching techniques key to improvisation, design and spontaneity exercises, and lessons on color. Every quilt made from one of Wood's scores will have common threads, but each one will look different because it reflects the maker's unique interpretation.

Do you find that at times you suddenly become defensive or enraged by an idle comment from a colleague? Or that your temper rises when another car cuts you off in traffic? Your reactions don't occur in a vacuum. They are the result of emotional and psychological triggers that often happen only in specific settings -- at meetings, or in competitive situations, or with a specific person who rubs you the wrong way, or when you feel under particular pressure. Being able to recognize those triggers and understand how the environment affects our behavior is key to controlling our responses and managing others at work and in life. Make no mistake -- change is hard. And the starting point is the willingness to accept help, and the desire to change. Over the course of this book, Marshall explores the power of active questions to get us to take responsibility for our actions -- and our failure to act. Questions such as \"Did I do my best to make progress toward my goal?\" \"Did I work hard at being fully engaged?\" He discusses the importance of structure in effecting permanent change. Because, he points out, change is hard, and without a structure to keep us on track, we inevitably relapse and fall back. Filled with stories from Marshall's work with executives and leaders, Triggers shows readers how to achieve meaningful and sustained change that will allow us to open our imaginations and escape the rigidity of binary thinking.",

    "description": "\"November, 1815. The Battle of Waterloo has come and gone, leaving the British economy in shreds; Henry Austen, high-flying banker extraordinaire, is about to declare bankruptcy dragging several of his brothers down with him. The crisis destroys Henry's health, and Jane flies to his London bedside, believing him to be dying. While she's there, the Reverend James Stanier Clarke, chaplain to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, invites Jane to tour Carlton House, the Prince's fabulous London home. Clarke is a fan of Jane's books, and during the tour he suggests she dedicate her next novel Emma to HRH, whom she despises. However, before she can speak to HRH, Jane stumbles upon a body sprawled on the carpet in (where else?) the Regent's library. The dying man, Colonel MacFarland, was a cavalry hero and a friend of Wellington's. He utters a single failing phrase: \"Waterloo map\" and Jane is on the hunt for a treasure of incalculable value and a killer of considerable cunning\"--",

    "title": "Little black dress",
    "description": "\"What's the most important garment in a woman's closet? More often than not, the answer is 'the little black dress.' For decades, fashion magazines have touted the LBD as the perfect solution to almost every fashion crisis. Dressed up or down, with flats or heels, statement jewelry or a subdued jacket, the little black dress can be worn anywhere, for any occasion. Where did the little black dress come from? And how did black become the color of choice for every occasion? In Little Black Dress, Shannon Meyer answers these questions by offering a visual history of the black dress, illustrating its transformation from a traditional mourning garment to the fashion staple it is today. Beginning with the Victorian era, Meyer describes how widows were required to wear plain black clothing with no decoration for one year and a day, as a symbol of full mourning. This gave way to concepts such as 'ordinary' and 'half' mourning that allowed for different fabrics and embellishments. Then, in the early twentieth century, women began to slowly adopt black into their everyday wardrobe, and, in the 1920s, Coco Chanel launched her revolutionary first line of black dresses, advertising them as versatile, affordable, and fashionable choices for women. As Meyer shows, other designers quickly followed suit, and black has since prevailed as a universal, ever appropriate, always fashionable choice. Richly illustrated with seventy full-color photos of dresses and accessories spanning 150 years, and including information about the designer, original owner, and historical context for each, readers will find Little Black Dress a stylish guide to this wardrobe essential. Designed to accompany an exhibit by the same name at the Missouri History Museum, the book will impress historians and fashionistas alike\"--",

Mitza Maric has always been a little different from other girls. Most twenty-year-olds are wives by now, not studying physics at an elite Zurich university with only male students trying to outdo her clever calculations. But Mitza is smart enough to know that, for her, math is an easier path than marriage. And then fellow student Albert Einstein takes an interest in her, and the world turns sideways. Theirs becomes a partnership of the mind and of the heart, but there might not be room for more than one genius in a marriage.",

Summer, 1809, and Captain Alan Lewrie, RN, wins fame, glory, and prize-money leading his squadron to victory over four French frigates. Battle damage, though, costs Lewrie his command, ship, and crew. He returns to London a hero, but, as weeks on half-pay turn to months, and no new command is offered, he's forced to lease a house and furnish it, unsure if he will ever go to sea again! At least Lewrie can have his portrait done by Miss Jessica Chenery, an intriguing young lady he takes for his wife, after seven years as a widower. In the midst of newly wedded bliss, an old friend poses a project for landing battalion-sized raids on enemy coasts. Though he never expects it to amount to anything, since it's too novel, Lewrie soon finds himself assigned to lead the proposed raid. Despite the stumbling blocks thrown in his way by his foes in the Navy, it's failure and ignominy, or shining success to prove himself to be won and rub their noses in it!\"--",

If you're ready to make your health a top priority and find your individual answer to healing your body then Stop Carrying the Weight of Your MS is an essential piece of the puzzle. Losing weight is a known solution to slowing multiple sclerosis progression and making symptoms more manageable. But diets can be very complex and restrictive, leaving people to feel lacking and like they're failing at staying healthy. The good news is losing weight doesn't have to be like that. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2000, Hanson found the key to lasting lifestyle change is making personally meaningful decisions. Building on books like Terry Wahls' The Wahls Protocol, and other MS diet books, Hanson moves beyond intense diets and regimens to help her readers create a new way of eating that is sustainable and customizable.",

    "description": "\"Birds are my passion,\" says Joanna Burger, \"but parrots are my weakness.\"  Fifteen years ago, when se adopted a neglected, orphaned thirty-six year old parrot named Tiko, she entered on of the most complex relationships of her life.Sullen and hostile when he entered Dr. Burger's home, Tiko gradually warmed as she carefully persuaded him of her good intentions.  Eventually he courted her, building nests inside household furniture during mating season and trying to coax her into them.  He nursed her vigilantly through a bout with Lyme disease, regularly preening each strand of hair on the pillow as she slept.  For a while he even fought her husband for her attentions, but eventually theirs became a relationship of deep mutual trust.The Parrot Who Owns Me is also the story of the science of birds, and of parrots in particular (America's third most commonly owned pet, after cats and dogs).  Woven into the narrative are insights and fascinating revelations from Joanna Burger's work -- not only about parrots, but about what it means to be human.By turns delightful, hilarious, touching, and enlightening, The Parrot Who Owns Me introduces us to an unforgettable bird and his human companion, whose friendships tells us much about ourselves.",

    "description": "It was crazy really, she had never met the woman, had no idea of her real name but she thought of her as a friend. Or, at least, the closest thing she had to a friend in Dublin. Struggling with a new baby, Yvonne turns to netmammy, an online forum for mothers, for support. Drawn into a world of new friends, she spends increasing amounts of time online and volunteers more and more information about herself. When one of her new friends goes offline, Yvonne thinks something is wrong, but dismisses her fears. After all, does she really know this woman? But when the body of a young woman with striking similarities to Yvonne's missing friend is found, Yvonne realises that they're all in terrifying danger. Can she persuade Sergeant Claire Boyle, herself about to go on maternity leave, to take her fears seriously?",

If it had not been for Bruce's willingness to defend her against the brutish Pug and Hal, she would have gladly returned to the workhouse. Then she became acquainted with Richard Baxton-Powell, but eventually his over-familiarity made her realise that despite everything her future would owe more to the Shalemans than any outside influence.",

Behind the author's personal recollections, with his own joys, sorrows and hopes, one sees a vivid picture of those times in the former Sovjet Union. He speaks warmly about his friends, both outside and inside the world of mathematics, about discovering his passion for mathematics and his early achievements, and about a number of mathematicians who influenced his professional life.

    "description": "This is the first textbook for psychologists which combines the model comparison method in statistics with a hands-on guide to computer-based analysis and clear explanations of the links between models, hypotheses and experimental designs. Statistics is often seen as a set of cookbook recipes which must be learned by heart. Model comparison, by contrast, provides a mental roadmap that not only gives a deeper level of understanding, but can be used as a general procedure to tackle those problems which can be solved using orthodox statistical methods.Statistics and Experimental Design for Psychologists focusses on the role of Occam's principle, and explains significance testing as a means by which the null and experimental hypotheses are compared using the twin criteria of parsimony and accuracy. This approach is backed up with a strong visual element, including for the first time a clear illustration of what the F-ratio actually does, and why it is so ubiquitous in statistical testing.The book covers the main statistical methods up to multifactorial and repeated measures, ANOVA and the basic experimental designs associated with them. The associated online supplementary material extends this coverage to multiple regression, exploratory factor analysis, power calculations and other more advanced topics, and provides screencasts demonstrating the use of programs on a standard statistical package, SPSS.Of particular value to third year undergraduate as well as graduate students, this book will also have a broad appeal to anyone wanting a deeper understanding of the scientific method.",

There was an agonising pause, and then the timekeeper announced the record: three minutes, fifty-nine point four seconds. But no one heard anything after that first word - 'three'. One of the iconic barriers of sport had been broken, and Roger Bannister became the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. Sixty years on and the letters still arrive on Roger Bannister's doormat, letters testifying to the enduring appeal of the four-minute mile, and the inspiring effect it had on a generation. In this frank, truthful memoir, one of the iconic figures of sport tells for the first time the full story of the dedication and talent that led to his unprecedented achievement, and of his professional life as a distinguished doctor and neurologist once his (strictly amateur) athletic career drew to a close.",

For each technology, both basic theory and practical applications are introduced. The book consists of two parts. In the first part, the basic principles of manufacturing technology for aspheric surfaces and key theory for deterministic subaperture polishing of aspheric surfaces are discussed. Then key techniques for high precision figuring such as CCOS with small polishing pad, IBF and MRF, are introduced, including the basic principles, theories and applications, mathematical modeling methods, machine design and process parameter selection.  It also includes engineering practices and experimental results, based on the three kinds of polishing tools (CCOS, IBF and MRF) developed by the author's  research team. In the second part, basic principles of measurement and some typical examples for large and middle-scale aspheric surfaces are discussed. Then, according to the demands of low cost, high accuracy and in-situ measurement methods in the manufacturing process, three kinds of technologies are introduced, such as the Cartesian and swing-arm polar coordinate profilometer, the sub-aperture stitching interferometer and the phase retrieval method based on diffraction principle. Some key techniques are also discussed, including the basic principles, mathematical modeling methods, machine design and process parameter selection, as well as engineering practices and experimental results. Finally, the team's research results about subsurface quality measurement and guarantee methods are also described. This book can be used as a reference for scientists and technologists working in optical manufacturing, ultra-precision machining, precision instruments and measurement, and other precision engineering fields.  A complete all-in-one reference to aspheric fabrication and testing for optical applications   Presents the latest research findings from the author's internationally recognized leading team who are at the cutting edge of the technology   Brings together surface processing and measurement in one complete volume, discussing problems and solutions   Guides the reader from an introductory overview through to more advanced and sophisticated techniques of metrology and manufacturing, suitable for the student and the industry professional   \"--",

    "title": "Running the race",
    "description": "There is a continuing fascination in the life of Eric Liddell (1902-1945). He remains one of the best-known and best-loved of all British sportsmen. In the award-winning movie, Chariots of Fire (1981), his success in the 400m at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris was powerfully portrayed. He was known as the 'man who would not run on a Sunday' and captured the imagination of a generation by his Christian character and by sacrificing fame and fortune to become a missionary in China, before his passing in a Japanese internment camp in 1945. This book is not a full biography of Eric Liddell. It is largely a sporting biography which weaves in to it Liddell's background, Christian position and subsequent missionary work. The author is the leading authority on Scottish track and field history and is presently a Presbyterian minister in Scotland. He was acquainted with Liddell's first biographer, D.P. Thomson, to whom he gave some assistance in the production of the earliest full biography of Liddell (1970). Whilst the book is in the nature of a 'personal tribute, ' it is from one who can speak with some authority on both the sporting side and Christian aspects of Eric Liddell's life, as a Scotsman, a former athlete and rugby player, an athletics historian and an evangelical Christian.",

The book examines the specific rules for creating intrigue and suspense, and confronts their universal features with selected literary texts. The individual texts emphasize the importance of understanding the emotions through transformation of various archetypes. The rules postulated by creative writing for building drama and tension in such texts often deal with this profound issue. They are thus not an end in themselves, but actually lead to more mature writing. Therefore, they essentially contribute to developing one's creative talent and communication skills. The paradigm of creative writing serves to shape the creativity of students of various disciplines, including not only literary studies and journalism, but also such diverse areas as medicine and information technology.",

While this dual approach has been spectacularly successful at solving problems, the language differences between algebra and analysis also represent a difficulty for students and researchers in geometry, particularly complex geometry. The PCMI program was designed to partially address this language gulf, by presenting some of the active developments in algebraic and analytic geometry in a form suitable for students on the 'other side' of the analysis-algebra language divide. One focal point of the summer school was multiplier ideals, a subject of wide current interest in both subjects. The present volume is based on a series of lectures at the PCMI summer school on analytic and algebraic geometry. The series is designed to give a high-level introduction to the advanced techniques behind some recent developments in algebraic and analytic geometry. The lectures contain many illustrative examples, detailed computations, and new perspectives on the topics presented, in order to enhance access of this material to non-specialists.\"--Publisher's description.",

Ziegler, whose contributions to Rajput studies are well known to specialists in the field, have given us a work of deep and exacting scholarship. It is the culmination of decades devoted to the study of Middle Marwari chronicles from Rajasthan. The sources translated here provide access to the fortunes of a branch of the Jodhpur royal family, and in doing so they illuminate the larger world of Rajputs in the middle period.  The Me?tiyo Ra?ho?s are significant for several reasons. Their story traces the emergence of a Rajput brotherhood into local prominence and follows the establishment of their kingdom on the eastern edge of Marva? as a defined territorial unit. The evolution of the Me?tiyos as a brotherhood passed through several clearly defined stages, including a relationship with the house of Jodhpur that ranged from mutual support among brothers to hostility and clear separation. A study of the Me?tiyos in this context provides a unique view of the formation of a strong and indpenedent Rajput cadet line, of the establishment and defense of a local territory, and of the internal relations among Rajput brotherhoods regarding issues of precedence, honor, patronage, and service.  The translations are accompanied by an extensive explanatory apparatus taking various forms, which includes a valuable essay on Rajput social organization, complete genealogies, and biographies of all the major personages of the chronicles.",

    "description": "\"A large part of the recent literature on program evaluation has focused on estimation of the average effect of the treatment under assumptions of unconfoundedness or ignorability following the seminal work by Rubin (1974) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). In many cases however, researchers are interested in the effects of programs beyond estimates of the overall average or the average for the subpopulation of treated individuals. It may be of substantive interest to investigate whether there is any subpopulation for which a program or treatment has a nonzero average effect, or whether there is heterogeneity in the effect of the treatment. The hypothesis that the average effect of the treatment is zero for all subpopulations is also important for researchers interested in assessing assumptions concerning the selection mechanism. In this paper we develop two nonparametric tests. The first test is for the null hypothesis that the treatment has a zero average effect for any subpopulation defined by covariates. The second test is for the null hypothesis that the average effect conditional on the covariates is identical for all subpopulations, in other words, that there is no heterogeneity in average treatment effects by covariates. Sacrificing some generality by focusing on these two specific null hypotheses we derive tests that are straightforward to implement\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.",

Despite its English commonlaw origin, strong legal protection provided by the law, and a democratic government, corruption within India's legal system and government significantly weakens investor protection in practice.  External financing of firms has been dominated by nonmarket sources of financing, while the characteristics of listed firms are similar to those from countries with weak investor protection.  The evidence, including results based on a survey of small and medium-scale private firms, shows that alternative financing channels provide the most important source of funds.  The authors also find that informal governance mechanisms, such as those based on reputation, trust, and relationships are more important than formal mechanisms (such as courts) in resolving disputes, overcoming corruption, and supporting growth. \"--World Bank web site.",

This investigation was conducted to determine if the chemical composition of asphalts as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) could be used to determine the significant differences between asphalts from good and bad roads. If so, perhaps this method could be used in a predictive manner for improved asphalt specification requirements. HPLC analysis of asphalt cements from roadways which varied in quality from good to bad showed highly significant differences. Using these differences, these roadways were classified into good, fair, poor and bad. Coupling these data with the relative amounts of asphalt sub-fractions and physical tests such as penetration at 77 deg. F and ductility at 40 degree F, a reasonable explanation for why a given roadway had reduced performance was established. Using HPLC analysis and sub-fraction quantities, a qualified prediction on the asplalt quality used in two newly constructed roadways has been advanced.",

When she wins three trunks of vintage haute couture at auction, she thinks her luck has changed -- but it's about to get much worse. The clothing's high-society matron owner turns up poisoned to death, and police seize the wardrobe, leaving Joanna with more debt, a friend wrongly jailed for diamond theft, and a convent of quirky nuns depending on her help. There's only one way to calmer waters: find the murderer, and fast.",

Some days you may write only one word-on other days you may be ready to tell a story, recall specific memories, or speak directly of your sorrow. To help you when you can't always think of something to write, prompts have been provided that may help you begin to make sense of your loss or focus on a specific topic.

    "description": "Slavery in the South has been documented in volumes ranging from exhaustive histories to bestselling novels. But the North's profit from---indeed, dependence on---slavery has mostly been a shameful and well-kept secret ... until now. In this startling and superbly researched new book, three veteran New England journalists demythologize the region of America known for tolerance and liberation, revealing a place where thousands of people were held in bondage and slavery was both an economic dynamo and a necessary way of life. Complicity reveals the cruel truth about the Triangle Trade of molasses, rum, and slaves that lucratively linked the North to the West Indies and Africa; discloses the reality of Northern empires built on profits from rum, cotton, and ivory---and run, in some cases, by abolitionists; and exposes the thousand-acre plantations that existed in towns such as Salem, Connecticut. Here, too, are eye-opening accounts of the individuals who profited directly from slavery far from the Mason-Dixon line---including Nathaniel Gordon of Maine, the only slave trader sentenced to die in the United States, who even as an inmate of New York's infamous Tombs prison was supported by a shockingly large percentage of the city; Patty Cannon, whose brutal gang kidnapped free blacks from Northern states and sold them into slavery; and the Philadelphia doctor Samuel Morton, eminent in the ninteenth-century field of \"race science,\" which purported to prove the inferiority of African-born black people. Culled from long-ignored documents and reports---and bolstered by rarely seen photos, publications, maps, and period drawings---Complicity is a fascinating and sobering work that actually does what so many books pretend to do: shed light on America's past. Expanded from the celebrated Hartford Courant special report that the Connecticut Department of Education sent to every middle school and high school in the state (the original work is required readings in many college classrooms,) this new book is sure to become a must-read reference everywhere.",

    "description": "\"From 1964 to 1966, Carlos Caggiani travelled to 26 countries on a 1947 Indian Chief motorcycle with hardly a penny to his name. At 24 years of age, he embarked on the adventure of a lifetime. He spent time with everyone from poor natives in the Andes mountains, to rich families in the United States. He crossed rivers without bridges, suffered famine, intense heat and cold, guided his motorcycle through rain and snow storms, rode on dirt and cobblestone roads, was chased by the FBI, was shot at in Bolivia during a revolutionary war, and had a serious accident due to a mechanical failure in Panama that left him hospitalized for 17 days. The experiences in this book demonstrate a human being's tenacity and triumph in the face of adversity, and shows that anything is possible. There is always something more just beyond the horizon, and as the horizon expands, our limits disappear\"--Back cover.",

    "title": "Five puzzles in the behavior of productivity, investment, and innovation",
    "description": "\"(1) Whatever happened to the cyclical effect? Skeptics were justified on the basis of data through the end of 1999 in their claim that part of the post-1995 productivity growth revival reflected the normal cyclical correlation between productivity and output growth.  In contrast data through mid-2003 reveal only a negligible cyclical effect for 1995-99 but rather a temporary bubble in 2002-03.  (2) Why did productivity growth accelerate after 2000 when the ICT investment boom was collapsing? The most persuasive argument points to unusually savage corporate cost-cutting and hidden intangible investments in the late 1990s that provided productivity benefits after 2000.  (3) The steady decline in the price of computer power implies steady technical progress, but then why did computers produce so little productivity growth before 1995 and so much afterwards? We draw an analogy to electricity, where miniaturization was the key step in making small electric motors practicable, and the internal combustion engine, where complementary investments, especially roads, were necessary to reap benefits.  (4) What does the collapse of the investment boom imply about the future of innovation? First-rate inventions in the 1990s, notably the web and user-friendly business productivity software, are being followed by second-rate inventions in the current decade.  (5) Finally, why did productivity growth slow down in Europe but accelerate in the U.S.? A consensus is emerging that U.S.  institutions foster creative destruction and financial markets that welcome innovation, while Europe remains under the control of corporatist institutions that dampen competition and inhibit new entry.  Further, Europe lacks a youth culture like that of the U.  S.  which fosters independence: U.  S.  teenagers work after school and college students must work to pay for much of their educational expense.  There is a chasm of values across the Atlantic\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

Few at the time thought the honor student, Eagle Scout, editor of his school paper, and president of his class every year since the seventh grade would survive. But John Allen Adams, son of a carnival fortune teller, did survive and was able to adapt to his severe handicap and go on to lead a remarkably successful life. Though left a quadriplegic, he proved to be a man of extraordinary inner resources, one who found freedom while bound to a wheelchair and independence while almost totally dependent on those around him. Woven from important strands of Arkansas history, his story reaches far beyond his small hometown, but his family's dramatic and distinguished past cannot account for the strength and amazing spiritual gifts of the man who inspired love from so many people. John Allen Adams was a skilled poet and a courageous worker for world peace, a man who triumphed over tragedy by finding within himself the resources to build a life that made a difference, a difference reflected in the testimonies and memories of those whose lives he touched.\" --p.

In this intimate dual memoir, she and her daughter, Ann, offer distinct perspectives as a fifty-something and a twenty-something, each on a quest to redefine herself and to rediscover each other.Between 1998 and 2000, Sue and Ann travel throughout Greece and France. Sue, coming to grips with aging, caught in a creative vacuum, longing to reconnect with her grown daughter, struggles to enlarge a vision of swarming bees into a novel. Ann, just graduated from college, heartbroken and benumbed by the classic question about what to do with her life, grapples with a painful depression. As this modern-day Demeter and Persephone chronicle the richly symbolic and personal meaning of an array of inspiring figures and sites, they also each give voice to that most protean of connections: the bond of mother and daughter.A wise and involving book about feminine thresholds, spiritual growth, and renewal, Traveling with Pomegranates is both a revealing self-portrait by a beloved author and her daughter, a writer in the making, and a momentous story that will resonate with women everywhere.",

The American Society of Botanical Artists, in collaboration with Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia, PA, curated an exhibition of original contemporary botanical artworks depicting plants discovered and introduced by the Bartrams, American pioneers in botany, horticulture, and natural history illustration. This remarkable family hungered for knowledge of the natural world, studied it closely, and dispersed details and methods of that study. They shaped a way of observation that we as botanical artists employ today, and the plants we observe have often passed throughtheir hands to ours. Focusing on the native plant discoveries made by John and [his son] William Bartram in their travels throughout the eastern wilderness between the 1730's and 1790's, the exhibition of forty-four original artworks allows a fresh look at their seminal body of knowledge and art. This illustrated, full-color book connects the exhibition's artworks to the historic father and son team who inspired them. In-depth essays and informative materials allow viewers and reders to better interpret this important history, as well as the role contemporary artists play in depicting these plants for today's audience and preserving their record for generations to come.\"--",

Customs and Border Protection is not prepared to fully enforce the new document requirement at land ports of entry. Although Customs and Border Protection has acquired and deployed substantial technological tools to aid in inspecting travelers, Customs and Border Protection has not analyzed the impact that a substantial increase in secondary inspection workload will have on secondary inspection staffing and infrastructure during full enforcement. The reported Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative compliance rates during the initial eight- month informed compliance period indicate noncompliant travelers arriving at the agency's 39 busiest land ports may increase the secondary inspection workloads at these ports by an average of 73% if all noncompliant travelers required secondary inspections. The agency has not finalized the operating procedures its officers will use to verify the identity and citizenship of noncompliant travelers. Until the new travel document requirement is fully enforced, the agency continues to incur risk that persons falsely claiming to be citizens of the United States, Canada, and Bermuda may be admitted to the United States. We are making four recommendations to better prepare the agency to fully implement the new requirement at land ports of entry.",

The Generic Solar System (GSS) provides a general and flexible tool for predicting the annual performance and financial viability of concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. With the GSS, the modeler can specify the solar field optical and thermal performance using a lookup table and polynomial correlations.

It's a grim, dangerous place to eke out an existence as a teenage girl -- until a handsome man arrives with a past and a brand-new basketball in tow. As the town's girls come together to form a team set on making it out of Poor Prairie, a murky committee of townspeople threatens to stamp out girls' sports altogether. Inspired by the flourishing and the decline of high school girls' basketball teams in the 1930s rural Midwest, The Tall Girl asks: Who can afford the luxury of play? And what is the cost of childhood? Featuring a strong ensemble of female characters, The Tall Girls examines issues of class and gender amidst the historic 1930s Dust Bowl.",

It is quite different from truancy and can lead to long-term adjustment difficulties if ignored or inappropriately treated. The purpose of this book is three-fold: first, to describe the nature of school phobia; secondly, to review the treatment literature exposing the common elements of the most successful, though theoretically different, approaches; thirdly, to provide a detailed step-by-step guide to the diagnosis and treatment of school phobia involving a rapid return to school and comprehensive behavioural management. The techniques and principles discussed are illustrated in a series of case studies. The book is aimed at parents and those professionals who regularly come into contact with children with school phobia, such as educational and clinical psychologists, child psychotherapists, behaviour therapists and family therapists, psychiatrists, paediatricians and family doctors, and teachers and researchers from all phases of education. If these professional groups could achieve a common understanding of school phobia, many more children could be treated quickly and effectively.\"--Provided by publisher.",

In The Beauty of the Metropolis he views the oft-maligned urban environment, acknowledging its shortcomings while also finding in it an aesthetic enrichment to rival any romanticised landscape. This forward-thinking essay raises the workaday city to rapturous heights, with flights of prose aspiring to the quality of music. Endell advocates a complete engagement with the here and now, drawing numerous examples from his own home, Berlin. From the clamour of Potsdamer Platz to quiet outlying districts, the author discovers visual pleasure in the rapidly expanding German capital where detractors found little more than squalor. Along the way Endell reconsiders the peculiarly German concept of heimat, incompletely translated as 'homeland'. The Beauty of the Metropolis is joined here by articles Endell wrote for a progressive journal in 1905, on subjects as diverse as modern art, busy streets and the passing of the seasons. An afterword and informative endnotes provide further insight into Endell's vision\"--Publisher's website.",

    "description": "Species of the coralline algal genus Phymatolithon are the dominant algal calcifiers in the rocky intertidal and photic sublittoral zone of the Subarctic-Boreal transition that stretches across the North Atlantic from the Gulf of Maine and the southern Canadian Maritimes to southwestern Iceland and the Norwegian outer Coast. In this paper, we use extensive field and laboratory data on the biology, physiology, and ecology of Phymatolithon species, supported by statistical analysis and DNA sequence data, to develop a multiscale view of this key genus of the ecosystems of this region. We demonstrate that species of Phymatolithon that occur in the Boreal-Subarctic transition zone in the North Atlantic can be segregated systematically by a statistical/developmental analysis of their morpho-anatomical characters. We show these results to be congruent with DNA sequence based methods. Six species are recognized: P. laevigatum, P. rugulosum (P. lamii), P. squamulosum (P. lenormandii), P. investiens, P. borealis sp. nov. (P.polymorphum) and P. nantuckensis sp. nov.). Based upon paraffin section, compound microscope and EDS-SEM analysis, we show that coralline anatomy comprises a diversity of both tissue types and high magnesium carbonate wall structure. Variation in vegetative tissue morphology, particularly with respect to cell division and elongation patterns, as well as variation in conceptacle (reproductive structure) location and development are due to a complex of genetic and environmental factors. Some of these factors can be linked to adaptation to environmental and biogeographical niches, providing a basis for experimental analysis of the mechanisms of adaptation.--Provided by publisher.",

Across photographic modes spanning portraiture, landscape, architecture and impromptu formalism, Pannell offers a series of vantages on a place that proves at once familiar, foreign and happily jarring in its multiplicity.\"",

He combines reproductions of artifacts such as the letters and snapshots from family albums with his own texts. Incidental personal events are described in a staccato stenographic commentary, juxtaposing them with historic events of the moment. Berg artistically stages this complex interaction in contrast to powerful photographs of period design objects.\"--Page 74.",

In this interview, Gryskiewicz picks up where the first left off after a brief discussion of the Center's launching of the Leadership Development Program in London, where he was also finishing his Ph.D. When Gryskiewicz returned to Greensboro, the managerial upheaval was still under way. Gryskiewicz discusses these changes in detail, focusing specifically on his perception of various leaders, including David DeVries, Mike Lombardo, Morgan McCall, David Campbell, and Bob Dorn. In addition to explaining how these leaders interacted with one another and how their positions evolved over time, he also describes how the Center was working to develop new curriculum for its creativity division, which he spearheaded, and a more centralized marketing department. In 1985, the presidency of the Center shifted to Walt Ulmer. Gryskiewicz describes both the transition of leadership, noting how Ulmer's leadership style differed from earlier leaders and on how the Center experienced rapid growth into the 1990s. Gryskiewicz also offers his thoughts on the Center's expansion into the global market, the new programs and workshops it offered in creative leadership development, and its commitment to diversifying its managerial staff to include more women and minorities.",

Existing studies indicate that the earth's wind energy supply potential significantly exceeds global energy demand.  Yet, only 1 percent of the global electricity demand is currently derived from wind power despite 40 percent annual growth in wind generating capacity over the past 25 years.  More than 98 percent of total current wind power capacity is installed in the developed countries plus China and India.  It has been estimated that wind power could supply 7 to 34 percent of global electricity needs by 2050.  However, wind power faces a large number of technical, economic, financial, institutional, market, and other barriers.  To overcome these barriers, many countries have employed various policy instruments, including capital subsidies, tax incentives, tradable energy certificates, feed-in tariffs, grid access guarantees and mandatory standards.  Besides these policies, climate change mitigation initiatives resulting from the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., CO2-emission reduction targets in developed countries and the Clean Development Mechanism in developing countries) have played a significant role in promoting wind power.   \"--World Bank web site.",

Rostnikov's fellow officers Sasha Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva go undercover to sniff out the facts. It doesn't help their case to know that their new boss, Director of Moscow Police Igor Yaklovev--capable but corrupt--seems a little too interested in bloody canine sport. And it really hurts when an animal breaks from the pack and takes what could be a mortal chunk out of one unsuspecting cop.Joined by Detective Emil Karpo, an apostle of old-fashioned Soviet justice, Rostnikov follows the crazily wending trails of high crime and low politics. The path will lead them to men whose ambition knows no limits and to places where no man stands a chance--and even to the ultimate question of who will live to rule Russia itself.",

    "description": "During the early twentieth century, Wilbur and Orville Wright faced a lengthy struggle over their recognition as the inventors of the airplane. This controversy still lingers today. Even their hometown, Dayton, Ohio, where the brothers spent years engineering and perfecting the airplane, hesitated in acknowledging their success. Promoted by a small group of individuals from the Smithsonian Institution, a decades long struggle ensued over who first invented an aircraft capable of powered flight. During the \"Smithsonian controversy,\" the institution embarked on a long and dangerous path of using its status as the nation's museum in an attempt to rewrite history. The ensuing battle with the Smithsonian Institution as well as other first flight claims left the Wright brothers' legacy in doubt. As a result, the Wright brothers engaged in a lifelong fight to protect and assure their rightful place in history. The brothers' drive to protect their legacy and Dayton's failure to recognize its aviation roots came together to leave aviation's birthplace without a focal point to commemorate the Wrights. Today, the Wrights' story is told in Dayton and North Carolina in part by the National Park Service, and at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. However, preoccupied with its industrial development and recovery from a devastating 1913 flood, Dayton took nearly a century to fully recognize its historic links to the Wright brothers and its aviation history. To analyze how the Wrights' concern over their legacy and Dayton's neglect of its heritage are linked, a chronological survey of the influencing events, trends, and ramifications is presented. The examined issues are often defined by political, social, cultural, and economic factors. How these factors shaped a definable evolutionary process in the connection between the Wrights' legacy and Dayton's commemoration of the Wrights are explored. The findings illustrate that the Smithsonian set a dangerous precedent by using its power as the nation's museum to advance its version of history. Repercussions from the Smithsonian controversy are seen in Dayton as Orville took the steps he felt were needed to assure the brothers' legacy in the United States.",

The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. Both the inflow and outflow rates have risen, but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly recently, with an influx of workers from Eastern European. The propensity to come to the UK to work is higher the lower is a) GDP per capita b) life satisfaction in each of the East European countries. There is reason to believe that the majority of those who have arrived in the UK from Eastern Europe have not come permanently. When surveyed only 9% said they expected to stay for more than two years. Hence, in our view it is inappropriate to call them migrants, whereas in fact they should more appropriately be considered temporary or guest workers. There is evidence that, as a result of this increase in the flow of workers from Eastern Europe, the fear of unemployment has risen in the UK which appears to have contained wage pressures. We argue that the influx of workers from Eastern Europe has tended to increase supply by more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run). We argue that this has acted to reduce inflationary pressures and reduce the natural rate of unemployment.",

    "description": "\"Over the past 25 years, significant levels of public debt and external finance are more likely to have enhanced macroeconomic vulnerability than economic growth in developing countries.  This applies not just to countries with a history of high inflation and past default, but also to those in East Asia, with a long tradition of prudent macroeconomic policies and rapid growth.  The authors examine why with the help of a conceptual framework drawn from the growth, capital flows, and crisis literature for developing countries with access to the international capital markets (market access countries or MACs).  They find that, while the chances of another generalized debt crisis have receded since the turbulence of the late 1990s, sovereign debt is indeed constraining growth in MACs, especially those with debt sustainability problems.  Several prominent MACs have sought to address the debt and external finance problem by generating large primary fiscal surpluses, switching to flexible exchange rates, and reforming fiscal and financial institutions.  Such country-led initiatives completely dominate attempts to overhaul the international financial architecture or launch new lending instruments, which have so far met with little success.  While the initial results of the countries' initiatives have been encouraging, serious questions remain about the viability of the model of market-based external development finance.  Beyond crisis resolution, which has received attention in the form of the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism, the international financial institutions may need to ramp up their role as providers of stable long-run development finance to MACs instead of exiting from them. \"--World Bank web site.",

But she's never traveled far enough to escape a painful moment that has haunted her for the past sixteen years: the day she gave her baby daughter away. Now, facing a life-altering crisis, she's decided to fix the broken pieces of her heart and seek out Lila, even if it means she has to upset the world of Lila's adoptive mother. . . her very own sister, Luz. Like a Technicolor tornado bursting into Luz's picture-perfect life, Jessie returns to her Texas hometown with a shattering request. She wants to tell Lila the truth. As Luz and her husband struggle with what Jessie's return may mean to the rebellious Lila, their seemingly solid marriage falters. Old secrets are exposed. Then, just as Jessie comes to terms with the past, life's bittersweet irony plays its hand. She meets Dustin Matlock, a young father who has survived a devastating loss. And Jessie begins to see the hopeful possibilities that lie buried in the most wrenching tragedies. Though she aches to reach out to those she loves, Jessie stands at the crossroads. She is leaving behind the only life she knows and leaping blindly into the unknown. Now the choice she makes will affect the life of her daughter and challenge the meaning of sisterhood. As Jessie and Luz examine the true meaning of love, loyalty and family, they are drawn into an emotional tug-of-war filled with moments of unexpected humor, surprising sweetness and unbearable sadness. But as the pain, regrets and mistakes of the past slowly rise to the surface, a new picture emerges - a picture filled with hope and promise and the redeeming power of the human heart.",

    "description": "\"Impact evaluations aim to measure the outcomes that can be attributed to a specific policy or intervention.  Although there have been excellent reviews of the different methods that an evaluator can choose in order to estimate impact, there has not been sufficient attention given to questions related to timing: How long after a program has begun should one wait before evaluating it? How long should treatment groups be exposed to a program before they can be expected to benefit from it? Are there important time patterns in a program's impact? Many impact evaluations assume that interventions occur at specified launch dates and produce equal and constant changes in conditions among eligible beneficiary groups; but there are many reasons why this generally is not the case.  This paper examines the evaluation issues related to timing and discusses the sources of variation in the duration of exposure within programs and their implications for impact estimates.  It reviews the evidence from careful evaluations of programs (with a focus on developing countries) on the ways that duration affects impacts. \"--World Bank web site.",

    "description": "Henry Aaron left his mark on the world by breaking Babe Ruth's record for home runs. But the world has also left its mark on him.\"Hammering Hank\" Aaron's story is one that tells us much about baseball, naturally, but also about our times. His unique, poignant life has made him a symbol for much of the social history of twentieth-century America.Raised during the Depression in the Deep South enclave of Mobile, Alabama, Aaron broke into professional baseball as a cross-handed slugger and shortstop for the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League. A year later, he and a few others had the unforgettable mission of integrating the South Atlantic League. A year after that, he was a timid rookie leftfielder for the Milwaukee Braves, for whom he became a World Series hero in 1957 as well as the Most Valuable Player of the National League.Aaron found himself back in the South when the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1965. Nine years later, in the heat of hatred and controversy, he hit his 715th home run to break Ruth's and baseball's most cherished record--a feat that was recently voted the greatest moment in baseball history. That year, Aaron received over 900,000 pieces of mail, many of them vicious and racially charged.In a career that may be the most consistent baseball has ever seen. Aaron also set all-time records for total bases and RBIs. He ended his playing days by spending two nostalgic seasons back in Milwaukee with the Brewers, then embarked on a new career as an executive with the Atlanta Braves. He was for a long time the highest-ranking black in baseball. In this position, Aaron has become an unofficial spokesman in racial matters pertaining to the  national pastime.Because of the depth and pertinence of Aaron's dramatic experiences, I Had A Hammer is more than a baseball autobiography. Henry Aaron's candor and insights have produced a revealing book about his extraordinary life and time.",

But even when the misunderstanding had been sorted out, all was not plain sailing, for David still considered her too young for him and was reluctant to commit himself too far. At least, that was what she supposed was his reason — until she discovered that there was another even more serious barrier to his ever marrying her.",

She's subletting an apartment with her best friend, Hope, working for a magazine that actually utilizes her psychology degree, and still deeply in love with Marcus Flutie, the charismatic addict-turned-Buddhist who first captivated her at sixteen. Of course, reality is more complicated than dreamy cliches. She and Hope share bunk beds in the \"Cupcake\"--the girlie pastel bedroom normally occupied by twelve-year-old twins. Their Brooklyn neighborhood is better suited to \"breeders,\" and she and Hope split the rent with their promiscuous high school pal, Manda, and her \"genderqueer boifriend.\" Freelancing for an obscure journal can't put a dent in Jessica's student loans, so she's eking out a living by babysitting her young niece and lamenting that she, unlike most of her friends, can't postpone adulthood by going back to school. Yet it's the ever-changing relationship with Marcus that leaves her most unsettled. At the ripe age of twenty-three, he's just starting his freshman year at Princeton University. Is she ready to give up her imperfect yet invigorating post-college life just because her on-again/off-again soul mate asks her to... marry him? Jessica has one week to respond to Marcus's perplexing marriage proposal. During this time, she gains surprising wisdom from unexpected sources, including a popular talk show shrink, a drag queen named Royalle G. Biv, and yes, even her parents. But the most shocking confession concerns two people she thought had nothing to hide: Hope and Marcus.Will this knowledge inspire Jessica to give up a world of late-night literary soirees, art openings, and downtown drunken karaoke to move back to New Jersey and be with the one man who's gripped her heart for years? Jessica ponders this and other life choices with her signature snark and hyper-intense insight, making it the most tumultuous and memorable week of her twenty-something life.From the Hardcover edition.",

    "description": "\"Recent papers by Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) uncover a dramatic decline in the volatility of U.S.  GDP growth beginning in 1984.  Determining whether the source is good luck, good policy or better inventory management has since developed into an active area of research.  This paper seeks to shed light on the source of the decline in volatility by studying the behavior of the U.S.  automobile industry, where the changes in volatility have mirrored those of the aggregate data.  We find that changes in the relative volatility of sales and output, which have been interpreted by some as evidence of improved inventory management, are in fact the result of changes in the process driving automobile sales.  We first show that the autocorrelation of sales dropped during the 1980s, and that the behavior of interest rates may be the force behind the change in sales persistence.  A simulation of the assembly plants' cost function illustrates that the persistence of sales is a key determinant of output volatility.  A comparison of the ways in which assembly plants scheduled production in the 1990s relative to the 1970s supports the intuition of the simulation\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

Although social scientists have long studied the causes of the riots, the consequences have received much less attention.  This paper examines census data from 1950 to 1980 to measure the riots' impact on the value of central-city residential property, and especially on black-owned property.  Both ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares estimates indicate that the riots depressed the median value of black-owned property between 1960 and 1970, with little or no rebound in the 1970s.  Analysis of household-level data suggests that the racial gap in the value of property widened in riot-afflicted cities during the 1970s\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

    "description": "\"An important result due to Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) is that differential commodity taxation is not optimal in the presence of an optimal nonlinear income tax (given weak separability of utility between labor and all consumption goods).  This article demonstrates that their conclusion holds regardless of whether the income tax is optimal.  In particular, given any commodity tax and income tax system, differential commodity taxation can be eliminated in a manner that results in a Pareto improvement.  Also, differential commodity taxation can be proportionally reduced so as to generate a Pareto improvement.  In addition, for commodity tax reforms that do not eliminate or proportionally reduce differential taxation, a simple efficiency condition is offered for determining whether a Pareto improvement is possible\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

    "title": "Profitable investments or dissipated cash?",
    "description": "\"The strong positive relationship between corporate cash flow and investment has been interpreted through the lens of both agency- and non-agency-based models.  In this paper, we distinguish between these two interpretations using project-level data in the oil and gas industry.  The specific projects we consider are auctioned-off leases that give mineral exploration rights to tracts of federal land.  We find the standard positive relationship between investment and cash flow in this data, in that positive shocks to residual cash flow (netting out firm and time effects) are associated with higher spending on these leases.  Interestingly, the increased investment comes from an increase in the price paid per tract with little to no change in the total number of tracts or total acreage of land bought.  The positive association between price and cash flow holds even after controlling for a set of tract and firm characteristics that might be ex-ante related to expected return on a given tract.  This data is most useful, however, because we can directly observe the eventual productivity of each of these projects.  We find that the increase in price induced by higher cash flow is associated with lower average productivity.  In fact, the total number of productive tracts does not increase with cash flow.  In other words, while higher cash flow is associated with higher spending on these projects, higher cash flow does not lead to higher revenues from these projects.  Combining this finding with the lack of a quantity response, we conclude that our results are best described by an agency model where managers use cash flow to simplify their job (or live a 'quiet life'') rather than 'empire-build.'\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

Firms appeared to use foreign earnings as a substitute for hedging with derivatives, and to engage in \"selective\" hedging. There was no evidence that East Asian firms eliminated their foreign exchange exposure by using derivatives.

    "description": "\"The paper presents research findings on the return intentions of Turkish professionals residing abroad. The study uses a descriptive framework to establish the validity of several proposed models of non-return. The results are based on an internet survey of Turkish professionals abroad. Correspondence analysis is used to examine the relationship between return intentions and various factors that may affect this intention. The results emphasize the importance of student non-return versus traditional brain and appear to complement the various theories of student non-return. The respondents appear to come from relatively well-to-do families with highly educated parents. Many have earned their degrees from universities that have foreign language instruction. The recent economic crises in Turkey have negatively affected return intentions. We verify that return intentions are indeed linked closely with initial return plans, and that this relationship weakens with stay duration. Specialized study and work experience in the host country also all appear to contribute to explaining the incidence of non-return. Return intentions are weaker for those working in an academic environment. These results lead to important policy implications, some of which include the training of individuals for academic positions at domestic institutions, supporting study abroad for shorter periods and improving academic facilities in Turkey's newly established universities. The government may support public and private R&D centers to increase the employability of returnees, but also to improve the quality of the higher education system in order to both reduce the need for education abroad and to increase the attractiveness of universities as prospective employment places for those acquiring education and experience abroad\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.",

To perform the test we suggest using a latent class count data framework, which allows modelling the turnover in the unobserved primary and secondary markets in the appropriate way. To illustrate the suggested approach we apply our methodology to the German labour market data. Our testing procedure finds no support for the predictions of the dual labour market theory.

We provide insights into why such frictions matter by examining which parts of trade these frictions reduce most.  Using data that tracks manufacturers' shipments within the United States on an exceptionally fine grid, we find that the pattern of shipments is extremely localized.  Shipments within 5-digit zip codes, which have a median radius of just 4 miles, are 3 times larger than shipments outside the zip code.  We decompose aggregate shipments into extensive and intensive margins, and show that distance and other frictions reduce aggregate trade values primarily by reducing the number of commodities shipped and the number of establishments shipping.  We consider two broad reasons for these facts and conclude that trade in intermediate goods is the most likely explanation for highly localized shipments and the dominant role of the extensive margin.  In addition, we find no evidence of state-level home bias when distances are measured precisely and trade is observed over a very fine grid\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.",

At the heart of Union Atlantic lies a test of wills between a young banker, Doug Fanning, and a retired schoolteacher, Charlotte Graves, whose two dogs have begun to speak to her. When Doug builds an ostentatious mansion on land that Charlotte's grandfather donated to the town of Finden, Massachusetts, she determines to oust him in court. As a senior manager of Union Atlantic bank, a major financial conglomerate, Doug is embroiled in the company's struggle to remain afloat. It is Charlotte's brother, Henry Graves, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, who must keep a watchful eye on Union Atlantic and the entire financial system. Drawn into Doug and Charlotte's intensifying conflict is Nate Fuller, a troubled high-school senior who unwittingly stirs powerful emotions in each of them. Irresistibly complex, imaginative, and witty, Union Atlantic is a singular work of fiction that is sure to be read and reread long after it causes a sensation this spring.From the Hardcover edition.",

    "description": "\"The best sports book of the year.\" - Sports Illustrated\"John Ed Bradley says that all he ever wanted to do was to leave behind a pretty piece of writing. Here it is-a wonderful blend of honest introspection, passionate reporting, and superb storytelling. One of the best books I have read in years.\"- Jeffrey Marx, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Season of LifeInspired by a classic essay about a visit to a dying coach, It Never Rains in Tiger Stadium explores in gorgeous detail the inescapable pull of college football-the cocky smiles behind the face masks, the two-a-day drills, the emotionally charged bus rides to the stadium, the curfew checks, the film-study sessions, the locker room antics, and the yawning void left in one's soul the moment the final whistle sounds. To understand why it's so painful to give up the game, you must first understand the intimacy of the huddle. \"It ends for everybody,\" writes John Ed Bradley, \"and then it starts all over again, in ways you never anticipated. Marty Dufresne sits in his wheelchair listening to the Tiger fight song...Ramsey Darder endures prison by playing the games over in his head...Big Ed Stanton never took up the game of golf, and yet he rides the streets of Bayou Vista in a cart nearly identical to Coach Mac's, recalling the one time the old man invited him for a ride.\" Far more than a memoir, It Never Rains in Tiger Stadium is a brutally honest, profoundly moving look at what it means to surrender something you love.An Amazon Editors' Best Book of 2007\"John Ed Bradley is a rare gem, a gifted writer trapped in the body of a football player. It Never Rains in Tiger Stadium will send chills down the back of anyone who loves the game and will echo in the minds of former players long after they've put it down.\"- Tim Green, best-selling author and member of the College Football Hall of Fame\"A mesmerizing read...achingly sentimental in some parts, brutally truthful in others...\"- Chicago Tribune\"The best memoir I have ever read on how a particular game, win or lose, can linger with us.\"- Josh Levin, Slate\"An unsparing and often beautiful chronicle of [Bradley's] attempt to join polite society.\"- Play Magazine\"A lyrical memoir...about his teammates, his coaches, his parents and the magnetic power of football in Louisiana.\"  - National Public Radio\"Heart-wrenching, honest, insightful and hard to put down.\"  - The Franklin SunFrom the Trade Paperback edition.",

    "description": "The most visually stunning Web site in the world is useless if it doesn’t function correctly. With Codin' for the Web you can ensure that yours will. Here to help you create sites that not only work, but work well--and are easy to update and maintain--is a straightforward, visual guide to Web programming basics from best-selling author Charles Wyke-Smith. Just as architects need to understand building materials and their properties, you need to understand the code that serves as the foundation for your sites. You'll learn that all dynamic Web sites consist of three basic components: a browser interface, Web server middleware, and a database. Using diagrams, code snips, and loads of screen shots, the guide covers everything from Web coding concepts and principles to building sites, designing visual interfaces, developing databases, developing middleware, ensuring a good user experience (through good code!), testing and debugging, and more. Charles Wyke-Smith has been creating Web sites since 1994 and is currently the Director of Production at Nacio, a corporate hosting and development company in Novato, California, that focuses on user experience, information architecture, and interface design. He has worked as a Web design consultant for such companies as Wells Fargo, ESPN Videogames, and University of California, San Francisco. Wyke-Smith has also taught multimedia and interface design and spoken at many industry conferences.",

To answer that question, this paper begins by reviewing unitary and bargaining models of intrafamily allocation, and then discusses the determinants of \"bargaining power\" in a world without taxes. It argues that wage rates rather than earnings are determinants of bargaining power, and then argues that productivity in household production is also a source of bargaining power. In the absence of human capital effects, joint taxation does not appear to disadvantage women in either divorce threat or separate spheres bargaining. Hence, the claim that joint taxation disadvantages women, if it is correct, depends on effects that operate through the incentives to accumulate human capital. But a satisfactory analysis of the effects of taxation on human capital awaits the further development of dynamic models of family bargaining\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.",

The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities",

    "description": "The fruit and vegetable production sector of Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Eastern Europe is facing a new situation where, on the one hand, supermarket chains account for an increasing percentage of the domestic food retail market and, on the other hand, producers must compete in an increasingly demanding global market for non traditional and off-season fruits and vegetables. Small farmers are increasingly being marginalized and will be facing unequal market conditions unless they are able to change their practices to meet the needs of a modern food marketing system. Regardless of the production system, the technological challenge is to increase returns through the rational use of available resources, reducing production costs and post-harvest losses, enhancing competitiveness and adding value to the final product.",

Travelling the length and breadth of Australia, he stops at nothing in search of this birdwatching Holy Grail, blowing his inheritance, his career prospects and any chance he has of finding a girlfriend.Part confessional, part travelogue, this is a true story about obsession. It's about seeking the meaning of life, trying to work out what normal' is, and searching for the elusive Grey Falcon (the bird, not the car). Sean's story of how he followed his childhood dream of becoming a national champion is both inspiring and ridiculous. Could this be the most pathetic great achievement in Australian history?",

    "description": "Organizational harmony and strategic alignment aren't enough to drive success.Until now, management wisdom would have you believe that the single most important thing leaders have to get right is alignment. To accomplish anything, employees must agree about the mission, strategy, and goals of an organization. Aligned employees are happy employees, and happy employees are productive employees. Simple, right?Well, in a word, no. Counter to conventional wisdom, the dirty little secret of leadership—what they don't tell you in business school—is that a leader's time is not always best spent trying to help his or her teams make nice and get along. In contrast, the authors' groundbreaking research shows that fostering productive dissent is essential for achieving peak efficiency—what Joni and Beyer call \"right fights.\"Right fights need to be well designed and subject to certain rules to be effective. Alignment cannot be ignored; without it, organizations can be plagued with bitter, energy-draining wrong fights. But a certain amount of healthy struggle is good for organizations. Right fights unleash the creative, productive potential of teams, organizations, and communities.The Right Fight turns management thinking on its head and shows why leaders—in the fast-moving, hyper-competitive marketplaces of the twenty-first century—need to foster alignment and orchestrate thoughtful controversy in their organizations to get the best results. Drawing from examples as diverse as Unilever, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Dell, the Clinton administration, and the Katy Independent School System, here is your playbook for picking the right battles and fighting the right fights well.",

Companies no longer have the option of ignoring the conversation.Unlike other hot social media spaces, Twitterville is dominated by professionals, not students. And despite its size, it still feels like a small town. Twitter allows people to interact much the way they do face-to-face, honestly and authentically. One minute, you're com- plaining about the weather with local friends, the next, you're talking shop with a colleague based halfway across the globe.No matter where you're from or what you do for a living, you will find conversations on Twitter that are valuable. Despite the millions of people joining the site, you'll quickly find the ones who can make a difference to you.Social media writer Shel Israel shares revealing stories of Twitterville residents, from CEOs to the student who became the first to report the devastation of the Szechuan earthquake; from visionaries trying to raise money for a cause to citizen journalists who outshine traditional media companies.Israel introduces you to trailblazers such as:Frank Eliason, who used Twitter to reverse Comcast's blemished customer service reputationBill Fergus, who was on the team at Henry Ford Medical Center during the first \"live tweeted\" surgeryScott Monty, social media officer for Ford, who held off a mob of misinformed Ranger fans and averted a PR crisisConnie Reece, who used Twitter to raise tens of thousands of dollars for cancer patients in needThe Coffee Groundz, a Houston-area coffee shop that uses Twitter to pack the tables (and fight off Starbucks)Twitterville features many true stories as dramatic as these. But it also recounts those of ordinary businesspeople who use Twitter to get closer to their customers. And it explains how global neighborhoods will make geography increasingly irrelevant.It even explains why people sometimes really do care what you had for lunch.",

So when she is invited to meet the vibrant, bohemian family next door in their messy house full of books and paintings and empty of rules, Carol soon begins a secret double life over the much-hated garden hedge. Here Carol voices her greatest fantasy and tells her first major lie...that she is adopted. But on her 16th birthday Carol receives the shock of her life when her wish comes true. And as, years later, Carol frenetically narrates her story from a psychiatric unit, we realise how it affected her and those around her in the darkest of ways . . .",

By tapping into their underutilized talents, knowledge, and skills you can earn tens of thousands of additional dollars per employee, and manage the interdepartmental complexities and barriers that prevent real achievements and profits.This can only be accomplished through organizational design and redesign. That's the new model for survival in the modern, digital, global economy. With the right design, your organization will have the capabilities to pursue whatever strategy is necessary to compete on any scale, react to any market change, leverage any opportunity, and sail past the competition.In Mobilizing Minds, the authors distill their research into seven strategic ideas that shatter the complexity frontiers, have the potential to unleash enormous profits, and enable long-term success for every company. Bryan and Joyce outline innovative principles that enable corporations to:Manage complexity, bureaucracy, and redundancyUse hierarchical authority to strengthen the authority of key managers and drive performanceDeliver operating earnings while implementing wealth-creation strategiesAllow formal networks, talent, and knowledge marketplaces to work in a large companyMotivate and reward wealth-creating behaviorPursue organizational design as a corporate strategyIncrease worker satisfactionIt is imperative for corporations to put the same energy used for new products and processes into organizational design. That's where the money is. That's where the opportunities lie. That's the key to surviving and prospering in the 21st century.",

It has inspired hundreds of thousands of readers around the world-but some have wondered how the story's lessons stand up to the tough challenges of everyday, real-world business.Bob Burg and John David Mann answer that question in Go-Givers Sell More, a practical guide that turns giving into the cornerstone of a powerful and effective approach to selling.Most of us think of sales as a struggle to make people do something they don't really want to do. But that cutthroat mentality makes the process much harder than it has to be-especially in an economic downturn when customers are more suspicious and defensive than ever.It's far more effective (and satisfying) when salespeople think like Go-Givers and focus exclusively on creating value for the customer. Cultivate a trusting relationship and provide outstanding service, say the authors, and great results will follow automatically.Drawing on a wide range of real-life examples of salespeople who have prospered by giving more, Burg and Mann offer tips and strategies that anyone in sales can start applying right away.",

And they won't leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business with the living. But Jesse, the hot ghost haunting her bedroom, doesn't seem to need her help. Which is a relief, because Suze has just moved to sunny California and plans to start fresh, with trips to the mall instead of the cemetery, and surfing instead of spectral visitations.But the very first day at her new school, Suze realizes it's not that easy. There's a ghost with revenge on her mind...and Suze happens to be in the way.",

    "title": "Quantitative Strategies for Achieving Alpha",
    "description": "Alpha, higher-than-expected returns generated by an investment strategy, is the holy grail of the investment world. Achieve alpha, and you've beaten the market on a risk-adjusted basis. Quantitative Strategies for Achieving Alpha was borne from equity analyst Richard Tortoriello's efforts to create a series of quantitative stock selection models for his company, Standard & Poor's, and produce a \"road map\" of the market from a quantitative point of view.With this practical guide, you will gain an effective instrument that can be used to improve your investment process, whether you invest qualitatively, quantitatively, or seek to combine both. Each alpha-achieving strategy has been extensively back-tested using Standard & Poor's Compustat Point in Time database and has proven to deliver alpha over the long term. Quantitative Strategies for Achieving Alpha presents a wide variety of individual and combined investment strategies that consistently predict above-market returns. The result is a comprehensive investment mosaic that illustrates clearly those qualities and characteristics that make an investment attractive or unattractive. This valuable work contains: A wide variet of investment strategies built around the seven basics that drive future stock market returns: profitability, valuation, cash flow generation, growth, capital allocation, price momentum, and red flags (risk); A building-block approach to quantitative analysis based on 42single-factor and nearly 70 two- and three-factor backtests, whichshow the investor how to effectively combine individual factors into robust investment screens and models; More than 20 proven investment screens for generating winning investment ideas; Suggestions for using quantitative strategies to manage risk and for structuring your own quantitative portfolios; Advice on using quantitative principles to do qualitative investment research, including sample spreadsheets.This powerful, data intensive book will help you clearly see what empirically drives the market, while providing the tools to make more profitable investment decisions based on that knowledge - through both bull and bear markets.",

They can do almost everything that mammals can do – and more. By mastering flight, they have a way of living that encompasses the whole world. In The Secret Life of Birds, Colin Tudge explores the life of birds, all around the globe. From the secrets of migration to their complicated family lives, their differing habitats and survival techniques to the secrets of flight, this is a fascinating account of how birds live, why they matter, and whether they really are dinosaurs. Colin Tudge shows how birds – who are like us in the general sense but very different in the particulars – live and think. For birds have minds: they feel, they are aware, they work things out. And so, by considering the birds, asking how and why it is possible for them to be so different, we gain insight into ourselves.Birds are beautiful, lively, intriguing – and all around us. This rich and endlessly absorbing book opens up their lives to everyone.",

    "title": "Chasing the Game",
    "description": "The U.S. men's soccer team was a huge disappointment at the World Cup in 2006, but a newly constituted team exceeded all expectations in June 2009 with their inspired play at the Confederations Cup in South Africa—where they upset the number one team in the world, Spain, and lost late in the championship game to a supremely talented Brazilian squad. Their impressive showing gave fans, including the ever-loyal Sam's Army, a renewed sense of hope that when the team plays up to its capabilities, the Americans can compete with anyone in the world. In Chasing the Game, Filip Bondy describes the U.S. team's path to qualifying for this year's World Cup—to be held on the African continent for the first time ever, in South Africa in June 2010. Bondy also reveals the back-and-forth saga that resulted in the hiring of Bob Bradley as the American coach, and serves up engaging profiles of several core players, including the U.S. national team's all-time leader in scoring and assists, Landon Donovan, acrobatic goalie Tim Howard, hip-hop devotee and opportunistic goal-scorer Clint \"Deuce\" Dempsey, up-and-comer Jozy Altidore, and the coach's son, the reticent yet dependable Michael Bradley. Chasing the Game also recounts the glorious highlights of past World Cup matches, like the U.S. men's team's stunning 1–0 victory over England in 1950 and the 2002 team's advance to the quarterfinals, as well as heartbreaks like the fiasco in 2006, when the U.S. mustered only four shots on goal in three games. Finally, Bondy also traces the origin of soccer and the evolution of the game in the U.S., chronicling how soccer academies like the one in Bradenton, Florida, have impacted the game at both the youth and national levels. It's all here for the first time in one book—the complete story of American soccer on the global stage.",

    "description": "It’s time to get back to business—real business. A decade of hands-off management has produced a stream of cost overruns, incomplete projects, and reduced productivity, not to mention a growing list of accounting scandals. Companies that prided themselves on thinking outside the box have been boxed in by their neglect of basic business processes and a failure to insist on accountability and quantifiable results.In Just Add Management Farzad and Rhonda Love Dibachi reveal that the technological advances of the past decade actually have brought most business organizations to the brink of a major productivity breakthrough. In order to leap the final hurdle, however, managers must find ways to set the priorities, track the progress, and measure the productivity of knowledge workers.This step-by-step guide to managing knowledge workers explores the realities and myths of today’s knowledge workplace, introduces the archetypes who populate it, and shows managers how to set the right tone in the office for every employee every day. It demonstrates ways in which managers can establish transparency—the state in which every member of the enterprise understands his or her role in the larger scheme and how that role influences the success of the entire organization.The authors introduce time-tested, proven management techniques that enable managers to set and broadcast priorities, agree upon and enforce processes, and track and monitor employees’ progress and accountability. They also show managers how to support this accountability management system with knowledge tools that provide accurate, timely business data in order to help organizations work smarter. These techniques provide the mechanics of visibility—data-driven insight into which employees are doing what and how well they are doing.Without the oversight of mature, focused managers who stress business fundamentals and organizational goals, all of the technological breakthroughs of the past decade are just expensive toys for technocrats and computer mavens. Just Add Management gives businesses and managers the tools and techniques they need to take control of the knowledge workplace, put their operations back on track, and make the next leap forward in productivity and profitability.",

Surprisingly, the only biography of this towering figure was written by his son, just two years after his death. Paul Gutjahr's book, therefore, is the first modern critical biography of a man some have called the \"Pope of Presbyterianism.\" Hodge's legacy is especially important to American Presbyterians. His brand of theological conservatism became vital in the 1920s, as Princeton Seminary saw itself, and its denomination, split. The conservative wing held unswervingly to the Old School tradition championed by Hodge, and ultimately founded the breakaway Orthodox Presbyterian Church. The views that Hodge developed, refined, and propagated helped shape many of the central traditions of twentieth- and twenty-first-century American evangelicalism. Hodge helped establish a profound reliance on the Bible among evangelicals, and he became one of the nation's most vocal proponents of biblical inerrancy. Gutjahr's study reveals the exceptional depth, breadth, and longevity of Hodge's theological influence and illuminates the varied and complex nature of conservative American Protestantism. - Publisher.",

At first he tries to live outside society, an unemployed drifter who takes a personal interest in defiantly--even violently--defending those in need. But when life as an urban Robin Hood fails to provide the answers he seeks, Paul takes a chance on the straight-and-narrow.",

    "description": "The vast majority of the U.S. population - some 80 percent - now lives in metropolitan areas, but population and employment continue to decentralize within regions, and density levels continue to decline at the urban fringe. Suburbanization is a long-standing trend that reflects the preference of many Americans for living in detached single-family homes, made possible largely through the mobility provided by the automobile and an extensive highway network. Yet these dispersed, automobile-dependent development patterns have come at a cost, consuming vast quantities of undeveloped land; increasing the nations dependence on petroleum, particularly foreign imports; and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global warming. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between land development patterns, often referred to as the built environment, and motor vehicle travel in the United States and to assess whether petroleum use, and by extension GHG emissions, could be reduced through changes in the design of development patterns. A key question of interest is the extent to which developing more compactly would reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and make alternative modes of travel (e.g., transit, walking) more feasible. The study is focused on metropolitan areas and on personal travel, the primary vectors through which policy changes designed to encourage more compact development should have the greatest effect.",

Most attempts to explain the role of brands focus on brands either as management tools (managerial perspective) or as symptoms of consumerism (sociological perspective). In Brand Society, Martin Kornberger combines these perspectives to show how brands have the power to transform both the organizations that develop them and the lifestyles of the individuals who consume them. This holistic approach shows how brands function as a medium between producers and consumers in a way that is rapidly transforming our economy and society. Using an array of practical case studies from a diverse set of organizations, this book provides a fascinating account of the way in which brands influence the lives of individuals and the organizations they work in\"--Provided by publisher.",

Drawing on extensive research and interviews in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada, Margaret Thornton considers the impact of the market on students, academics and law schools, documenting how both the curriculum and pedagogical methods have changed. If the passing of the idea of the university is rued, concern usually focuses on the humanities and the natural sciences. In this respect, law has been regarded as privileged because of the virtually unstoppable demand for law places and the willingness of students to pay high fees. And, as this book shows, it is commercial and instrumental forms of legal training that are now favoured, whilst the humanistic, critical, theoretical and social justice aspects of legal knowledge have now been corroded. Privatising the Public University will be of considerable interest to legal academics; but it will also be invaluable work for anyone interested in the future of higher education\"--",

Further, this collection considers how oral history interviews themselves--the sounds of voices--are recorded and listened to in particular places: on walks, in theatres, at home on the internet. In doing so, this volume highlights the importance of thinking methodically about place not only in terms of the content of interviews, but also their creation, dissemination, and reception\"--",

The central premise of the book is that, in reflecting on the eoikos status of their accounts, Xenophanes, Parmenides and Plato are manipulating the contexts and connotations of the term as it has been used by their predecessors. By focusing on this continuity in the development of the philosophical use of eoikos, the book serves to enhance our understanding of the epistemology and methodology of Xenophanes, Parmenides and Plato's Timaeus\"--",

STAIRS is an international meeting which aims to support AI researchers from all countries at the beginning of their career, and PhD students or those who have held a PhD for less than one year. It offers doctoral students and young post-doctoral AI fellows a unique and valuable opportunity to gain experience in presenting their work in a supportive scientific environment, where they can obtain constructive feedback on the technical content of their work as well as advice on how to present it, and where they can also establish contacts with the broader European AI research community. The topics cover a broad spectrum of subjects in the field of AI: learning and classification, ontologies and the semantic web, agent programming and planning, logic and reasoning, economic approaches, games, dialogue systems, user preferences and recommender systems. Offering an opportunity to glimpse the current work of the AI researchers of the future, this book will be of interest to anyone whose work involves the use of artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.\"--Publisher description.",

In The Faith of Leap, Michael Frost and Alan Hirsch challenge you to leave the idol of security behind and courageously live the adventure that is inherent in our God and in our calling. Their corrective to the dull, adventureless, risk-free phenomenon that describes so much of contemporary Christianity explores the nature of adventure, risk, and courage and the implications for church, discipleship, spirituality, and leadership\" -- BACK COVER.",

    "description": "\"Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa, are the most common and widespread health risk associated with drinking water. Most waterborne pathogens are introduced into drinking water supplies by human or animal faeces (enteric pathogens) but they can also exist naturally in water environments as indigenous aquatic micro-organisms. Controlling the risks related to these pathogens is a permanent challenge for the water industry. In addition to the constantly evolving range of pathogens to consider, assessing and managing such risks requires the integration of information issued by a wide range of disciplines. The necessary knowledge is however still sketchy and incomplete for most pathogens, and research efforts are necessary to fill the remaining gaps of knowledge. The purpose of this study is to provide an updated, comprehensive review of current knowledge on a selection of pathogens of interest for the drinking water industry, and to identify the remaining gaps of knowledge and thus the necessary research to be conducted. Emphasis has been laid on the information needed to assess and manage the risks related to each of these pathogens in drinking water production and distribution. The pathogens considered in this review were selected on the basis of their recognized or highly suspected transmission by drinking water through ingestion, inhalation, or contact; their recognized pathogenic character for humans; and the severity of their health effects. Each micro-organism in this study is described in a summary fact sheet composed of the following items: microbiology, human health effects, geographical distribution, epidemiology, ecology, inactivation/removal, surrogates, environmental detection and research needs. Since much remains unknown about many aspects that are common to viruses, the study features a general section on virus research needs. A special section summarizes the risk management research conducted on waterborne pathogens. Finally, the conclusion gives an overview of the main gaps in current knowledge on waterborne pathogens.\"--Publisher's description.",

These are the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and the Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions. These surveys help reach conclusions about fundamental policy questions, such as whether a given field of research is adequately funded, whether funding is balanced among fields, and whether deficiencies in funding may be contributing to a loss of U.S. scientific or economic competitiveness. However, the survey data are of insufficient quality and timeliness to support many of the demands put on them. In addition the surveys are increasingly difficult to conduct in times of constrained resources, and their technological, procedural, and conceptual infrastructure has not been modernized for procedure or content. Data on Federal Research and Development Investments reviews the uses and collection of data on federal funds and federal support for science and technology and recommends future directions for the program based on an assessment of these uses and the adequacy of the surveys. The book also considers the classification structure, or taxonomy, for the fields of science and engineering.\"--Publisher's description.",

    "description": "The Christian Bible is fundamentally a story. Writers, painters, sculptors, artists, and indeed, people of all walks of life live by the telling of their stories. Stories are the most basic mode of human communication. Thus it is vital to ask why Christians and above all Christian theologians so often fail to express their faith in terms of story. The vast majority of the Hebrew Scriptures, for example, consists of stories. Jesus proclaimed and taught about the Reign of God through stories and parables. At the heart of the Christian faith are stories, not concepts, propositions, or ideas. Given the deep rootedness of the Christian faith in storytelling, this book seeks to address the fact that Christian theology has too often taken the form of concepts, ideas, and systems. This book is an attempt to speak of Christian faith and theology in stories rather than systems. Through stories, both biblical and non-biblical, this book shows how we might reimagine the task of Christian theology in the life of faith today. At its heart is the conviction that in the beginning there were stories and that, in the end and indeed, beyond the end, are stories, not texts, ideas, and concepts.",
